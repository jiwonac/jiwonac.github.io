My current research interest lies at the intersection of data management, coresets, and sampling algorithms. I aim to enable **in-database machine learning at interactive speed** through **data-efficient machine learning** and **approximate coreset query algorithms**. Iâ€™m focusing on submodular gradient approximation and diversity for accuracy and robustness. Some of my current *big questions* are:

1. How can we efficiently and accurately summarize relational data and data lakes for machine learning?
2. How can we efficiently sample from semi-structured or non-structured data, and leverage sampling to accelerate coreset generation?
