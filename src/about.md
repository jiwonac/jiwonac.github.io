<p class="poster-text">Hi! I'm <strong class="highlight">JIWON CHANG</strong>, a <span class="highlight">computer science PhD student</span>. I research <span class="highlight">data management algorithms</span> at the University of Rochester's <a href="https://dataintelligencecrew.github.io/">Data Intelligence Lab</a> with professor <a href="https://fnargesian.com/">Fatemeh Nargesian</a>.</p>

My current research interest lies at the intersection of data management, AI/ML, and sampling algorithms. I aim to enable **in-database machine learning at interactive speed** through **approximate (core)set query algorithms**. Some topics of current interest include:

* Coresets in databases. 
* Querying data for model improvement. 
* Fast sampling algorithms for approximate query processing. 

My interests outside of computer science include bug friends and houseplants, science fiction, gaming, minimal and intentional living. 

This is my home on the interwebs. You can find [blog posts](/blog), a more casual [microblog](/microblog), my "online CV" — [education](/education), [professional](/professional), [research](/research), external [writings](/writings) — and what I'm up to [now](/now).
