<p class="poster-text">Hi! I'm <strong class="highlight">JIWON CHANG</strong>, a <span class="highlight">computer science PhD student</span>. I research <span class="highlight">data management algorithms</span> at the University of Rochester's <a href="https://dataintelligencecrew.github.io/">Data Intelligence Lab</a> with professor <a href="https://fnargesian.com/">Fatemeh Nargesian</a>.</p>

My current research interest lies at the intersection of data management, AI/ML, and sampling algorithms. I aim to enable **in-database machine learning at interactive speed** through **approximate (core)set query algorithms**. Some topics of current interest include:

* Coresets in databases. <small>(In particular submodular coresets for neural nets & deep learning, applied to semi-structured and relational data.)</small>
* Querying data for model improvement. <small>(Underperformance and coverage issues, querying & processing training data.)</small>
* Fast sampling algorithms for approximate query processing. 
* Semi-structured and non-structured data processing.

I am from 🇰🇷, lived in 🇨🇳 for a long while, and now reside in 🇺🇸. 

My current hobbies and interests outside of computer science include: 

* [Bug friends](/microblog/2023-11-06/) and houseplants. <small>(I used to be interested in ecology and evolutionary biology; nowadays living friends suffice.)</small>
* Hard science fiction. <small>(I especially love second-wave feminist cyberpunk and speculative evolution.)</small>
* Video games. <small>(Walking simulators, roguelites, and other interactive narratives.)</small>
* Feminist and queer issues. <small>(I believe in the positive impact of being publicly 🏳️‍🌈.)</small>
* Minimal and intentional living & technology.
