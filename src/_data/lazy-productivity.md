I'm really lazy. Not to mention highly distractable, often dealing with work-related anxiety and procrastination. Oh, and I have an addictive personality as well. 

If that sounds like a disaster, it's because it is. 

Sometimes, superhumans among us will give the advice to "just do it" or "just get disciplined." *Well Jeff, I'm asking for advice precisely because I can't "just do it."* 

With that said, I must be doing *something* right, since I managed to get an engineering degree and get into a PhD program. The following are some mental frameworks and concrete strategies which actually worked for me. 

### Framework: Mold the environment, do not depend on discipline

If you're like me, you have zero discipline. You have aspirations and skills, but you just can't do it. 

If you don't have discipline, attempting to rely on it is a fool's errand. Instead, mold an environment in which you will function even without discipline. 

#### Strategy: Borrow electronics from a personal library

Electronics are one of the most common sources of distraction. You know it, I know it. 

Yet when those of us with addictive personalities try to limit electronics usage or access, we end up finding a way to circumvent it. 

The fundamental problem is that the electronic was in front of you in the first place. As such, when you're done using a device, return it to a special place that is hidden away from view. This is your library of electronics. I store my portable devices like my laptop and my Steam Deck in a wall cabinet. Desktop PC goes into a closet. 

Simply not having the device in view helps clear it from the mind, which reduces the urge to endulge in electronic distractions. 

If you need to use a device, borrow it from your personal library. Return when you're done using it. 

My desk setup involves a USB-C hub with an HDMI port and enough USB ports for peripherals. By default, nothing is plugged into it; a purely analog desk setup by default. 

And yes, I haul my gaming PC away every time I'm done with a gaming session. 

#### Strategy: Do not let distractable or addictive things into the house

I'm the exact kind of person to smoke one joint at 30 then die of lung cancer at 40. Of course, I don't want that to happen. Since I can't rely on my willpower to quit or moderate, I do not start any addictive or distracting habit in the first place. 

I never use any substances whatsoever, including the more moderate ones like alcohol, weed, or caffeine. I don't create accounts for distracting websites or predatory games. It makes life a bit boring, in a good way. 

### Framework: Do it for others, not yourself

Even in the midst of clinical depression, when I was having difficulties getting up from bed, if a friend needed me, I was there for them. 

Unless you have ASPD, it is probably easier to motivate yourself to do a task it if helps others, rather than being all about your own gains. 

#### Strategy: Reframe your tasks as an act of helping

#### Strategy: Study to teach

### Framework: Conquer productive procrastination

#### Strategy: Stare at the wall

#### Strategy: Use the dumbest tool that works
