In this post, I will try to describe a simple system for technical research that uses only basic analog tools with the occasional digital compromise. 

## Why Analog?

I've previously written about [why I prefer analog mediums](/blog/analog-king) and [living without "optional" websites](/blog/without). Without repeating myself too much, my disdain for digital tools essentially boils down to accepting that I am a bumbling idiot with a primate brain. I am easily distracted, fall into perfectionist tendencies, and sem to lack object permanence. Physically removing computers from the room, only giving myself some scrap paper and a black pen, and using tangible physical artifacts help remedy much of my psychological pitfalls. 

If your self-discipline is better than me, then the friction caused by analog tools may be entirely wasted effort. For me? Many of these frictions are *eufrictions*. 

## What's the Purpose?

Andy Matuschak [noted](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zUMFE66dxeweppDvgbNAb5hukXzXQu8ErVNv) that "People who write extensively about note-writing rarely have a serious context of use." There are many "gurus" and practitioners in the whole productivity/note-taking space that pursue the perfect system without a concrete application in mind. 

While I can't judge anyone's hobby, it is entirely pointless to spend extensive time writing things that do not bring joy, nor help produce concrete output. Thus, my system is laser-focused at my current mid-term goal within the next few years: getting my PhD. Those with a different purpose for building an analog research system would probably need to modify my system such that their tools help with their productive - in the sense of producing tangible output - pursuits. I'll elaborate how even my field influences my design choice. 

## What Must be Done to Accomplish my Goal?

By clearly defining my goal - get a Phd - I can now assess the concrete set of tasks that my system should help me accomplish. Ultimately, I need to write and defend a thesis, which requires publishing three or more loosely connected papers. There are a mix of responsibilities, which can be broadly categorized as:

1. Learning: coursework, literature review,
2. Admin work: teaching and other tasks, and
3. Producing original research. 

Admin work simply needs to get done. Learning is important insofaras it contributes to research; thus, it's more important earlier in the PhD than later. The priority is to produce original research. The goal is not only to write three papers, but to write three or more papers that are in some way connected to each other, that are published in competitive venues and are cited well. 

This means that we need a system for ensuring the busywork doesn't get dropped. We need a method of picking up difficult subjects quickly, and working on a a set of topics for a number of years. 

We also need to consider my field. I work on a traditionally systems-oriented subdiscipline of computer science from a more theoretical perspective. That means my work is significantly different from a humanities scholar, or an empirical scientist. The systems side of things involves experiments, though much more basic than, say, experimental physics. The analysis side of things involves math, though with a bit less rigor than pure mathematics. The standard method of keeping track of experiments is to keep a lab log as well as well-documented data. There is some level of "responding to other papers' arguments", though with much less emphasis than political philosophy. 

## The Components

My analog research system is comprised of four basic components: marginalia, scratch papers, journal, and index cards. They each serve a distince purpose. 

1. Marginalia is useful for processing primary sources, with the exception of mathematics. 
2. Scratch papers are useful for processing technical sources. 
3. Journals are useful for keeping a linear, chronological record of my work, and for planning out the near future. 
4. Index cards are useful for developing ideas in a nonlinear fashion on a selection of topics over a long period of time. 

I will now describe each component in more detail. 

### Marginalia

Since I can't focus very well on an ebook, I will typically borrow, buy, or print books and papers. While I obviously cannot write on library books, if a book seems like it will be a useful reference for the forseeable future, I will make an effort to find a cheap copy for keeping and marginalia. 

Marginalia is most useful for two main objectives. 

1. Summarizing the author's argument to enhance my understanding of the text. 
2. Responding to the author's argument in some way. 

For the first purpose, I will typically restate the author's argument in a few keywords or abbreviated sentence or two every section or every page, as needed. For the second purpose, I use a variety of symbols such as ??? (confusion), â˜† (important), and would often write down my disagreements or ideas about how to apply an idea for my research.
