Most species of forget-me-nots (_Myosotis sp._) are non-native to North America. This colony, which occupies wide swaths of my back yard through its rhizomous spread, is most likely the highly invasive _Myosotis scorpiodes_ from Europe. I will most likely need to resort to herbicide control in the near future. It's a shame, since it is quite the pretty flower.
