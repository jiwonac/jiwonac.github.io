<p class="poster-text">Hi! I'm <strong class="highlight">JIWON CHANG</strong>, a <span class="highlight">computer science PhD student</span>. I research <span class="highlight">data management algorithms</span> at the University of Rochester's <a href="https://dataintelligencecrew.github.io/">Data Intelligence Lab</a> with professor <a href="https://fnargesian.com/">Fatemeh Nargesian</a>.</p>

<p>My current research interest lies at the intersection of data management, AI/ML, and randomized algorithms. I aim to enable <b>in-database machine learning at interactive speed</b> through <b>approximate (core)set query algorithms</b>. Some topics of current interest include:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Coresets in databases.</b> In particular, (submodular) coresets for (deep) learning, applied to relational data.</li>
    <li><b>Data management for model improvement.</b> Querying & processing algorithms to diagnose and fix underperformance and representation issues.</li>
    <li><b>Approximate non-aggregate query answering.</b> Approximate top-k, package, and clustering queries.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am from 🇰🇷, lived in 🇨🇳 for a long while, and now reside in 🇺🇸. I go by she/they pronouns.</p>

<p>My hobbies and interests outside of computer science include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b><a href="/microblog/2023-11-06/">Bug friends</a> and houseplants.</b> I nearly minored in biology, and still get excited about ecology and evolutionary biology.</li>
    <li><b>Science fiction novels and media.</b> I especially love <a href="https://www.fellowtraveller.games/citizen-sleeper">cyberpunk</a> and other genres of sci-fi with <a href="https://library.ltikorea.or.kr/writer/202072">progressive</a> <a href="https://massif-press.itch.io/">themes</a>, and speculative evolution (and a <a href="https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/adrian-tchaikovsky/children-of-time/9781447273301">few</a> with <a href="https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/adrian-tchaikovsky/the-doors-of-eden/9781509865918">both</a> elements).</li>
    <li><b>Video games</b>, in particular <a href="https://dont-nod.com/en/games/life-is-strange/">walking simulators</a>, <a href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/">roguelites</a>, and other <a href="https://www.zachtronics.com/eliza/">interactive narratives</a>.</li>
    <li><b>Feminist and queer issues</b>: I believe in the positive impact of being publicly 🏳️‍🌈.</li>
    <li><b>Intentional living & technology.</b> Physical and digital minimalism, FOSS, harmonizing analog and digital.</li>
</ul>
