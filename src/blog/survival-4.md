blurb: "Position your computer desk and analog workspace opposite to each other to avoid digital distractions during offline work."

My newly furnished home office, where I spend much of my workdays, has two tables. 

The small table to the left is the computer desk. I keep the surface clear of anything except keyboard and mouse. 

The large table to the right is the designated analog workspace. It has my index cards, books, pile of papers, a bookstand, scrap paper, and a printer. 

Since the tables are positioned opposite to each other, I am not distracted by my computer in the corner of my field of vision when working offline. 

I highly recommend other WFH academics to separate digital and analog workspaces.
