It is a typical day at the seaside fishery, a nationwide chain. Folks bustle about, browsing and haggling. Prawns and shellfish on the floor; frozen salmon and cod on ice trays above, towered only by the tanks reserved for big fish, still alive. 

Everyone is busy, selling and browsing, except Coco. His large pearl eyes refract the ceiling lights. The cacophony of fishmongers and housewives overwhelms him. He retreats to old memories. 

"Son, you're gonna be the real deal." His dad used to say. "You'll be bigger than I. Go out into the world." 

And so Coco did. He became an explorer and reached unknown seas, into dangerous waters far from home. 

"It's a dog-eat-dog world out there, son. They die, or you die."

And so Coco listened. He ate his daily diet of liver. He trained his muscles, swimming every day. None could challenge him. 

While hunting a spearfish, he lost his focus. Then the incident...

"I made it, dad." Coco the shark mutters to himself. He awaits his fate at the topmost fish tank, reserved only for the rarest delicacy. 

"I'm at the top of the food chain..."
