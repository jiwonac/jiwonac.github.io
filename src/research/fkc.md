blurb: "Efficiently obtain coresets that cover every point in the dataset while adequately representing groups of interest."
---

We study the fair $k$-cover problem, which aims to efficiently obtain coresets such that 1) every point in the full dataset is covered by a point in the coreset at least $k$ times, and 2) points in the coreset adequately represent groups of interest. We solve the problem through a reduction to submodular optimization. Our $\mathrm{F}\mathcal{K}\mathrm{C}$ coresets reduce accuracy disparity while generating coresets rapidly.
