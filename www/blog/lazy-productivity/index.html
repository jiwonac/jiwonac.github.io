                            <p>I'm really lazy. Not to mention highly distractable, often dealing with work-related anxiety and procrastination. Oh, and I have an addictive personality as well.</p>
<p>If that sounds like a disaster, it's because it is.</p>
<p>Sometimes, superhumans among us will give the advice to &quot;just do it&quot; or &quot;just get disciplined.&quot; <em>Well Jeff, I'm asking for advice precisely because I can't &quot;just do it.&quot;</em></p>
<p>With that said, I must be doing <em>something</em> right, since I managed to get an engineering degree and get into a PhD program. The following are some mental frameworks and concrete strategies which actually worked for me.</p>
<h3>Framework: Mold the environment, do not depend on discipline</h3>
<p>If you're like me, you have zero discipline. You have aspirations and skills, but you just can't do it.</p>
<p>If you don't have discipline, attempting to rely on it is a fool's errand. Instead, mold an environment in which you will function even without discipline.</p>
<h4>Strategy: Borrow electronics from a personal library</h4>
<p>Electronics are one of the most common sources of distraction. You know it, I know it.</p>
<p>Yet when those of us with addictive personalities try to limit electronics usage or access, we end up finding a way to circumvent it.</p>
<p>The fundamental problem is that the electronic was in front of you in the first place. As such, when you're done using a device, return it to a special place that is hidden away from view. This is your library of electronics. I store my portable devices like my laptop and my Steam Deck in a wall cabinet. Desktop PC goes into a closet.</p>
<p>Simply not having the device in view helps clear it from the mind, which reduces the urge to endulge in electronic distractions.</p>
<p>If you need to use a device, borrow it from your personal library. Return when you're done using it.</p>
<p>My desk setup involves a USB-C hub with an HDMI port and enough USB ports for peripherals. By default, nothing is plugged into it; a purely analog desk setup by default.</p>
<p>And yes, I haul my gaming PC away every time I'm done with a gaming session.</p>
<h4>Strategy: Do not let distractable or addictive things into the house</h4>
<p>I'm the exact kind of person to smoke one joint at 30 then die of lung cancer at 40. Of course, I don't want that to happen. Since I can't rely on my willpower to quit or moderate, I do not start any addictive or distracting habit in the first place.</p>
<p>I never use any substances whatsoever, including the more moderate ones like alcohol, weed, or caffeine. I don't create accounts for distracting websites or predatory games. It makes life a bit boring, in a good way.</p>
<h3>Framework: Do it for others, not yourself</h3>
<p>Even in the midst of clinical depression, when I was having difficulties getting up from bed, if a friend needed me, I was there for them.</p>
<p>Unless you have ASPD, it is probably easier to motivate yourself to do a task it if helps others, rather than being all about your own gains.</p>
<h4>Strategy: Reframe your tasks as an act of helping</h4>
<h4>Strategy: Study to teach</h4>
<h3>Framework: Conquer productive procrastination</h3>
<h4>Strategy: Stare at the wall</h4>
<h4>Strategy: Use the dumbest tool that works</h4>
