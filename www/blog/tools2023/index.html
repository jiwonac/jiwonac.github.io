                            <p>I don't know where I first heard someone quip:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A good craftsman never blames his tools, for a good craftsman already has good tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, tools are rarely the defining differentiating factor between the novice and the master, though knowing and utilizing best tools does help. So here are the digital and productivity-related tools that I use at the moment!</p>
<p>My general philosophy for choosing my tools are summarized below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Segregate certain contexts into separate hardware.</li>
<li>Store data in flat file formats.</li>
<li>Use lightweight software for my old laptop.</li>
<li>Prefer free and open source software without being a purist.</li>
<li>Good default configurations are good.</li>
</ol>
<p>With that said, let's start the list.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thinkpad t470s</strong>: My main work device.<br>
Although it's 5 years old at this point, it can do everything except graphically demanding tasks. Selling at around $200 USD refurbished, it fit well into a student budget after my old MacBook broke from water damage and I was looking for a laptop that will run Linux. I chose the t470s over the t470 since I heard there was an upgrade in build quality, which does matter for laptops.</li>
<li><strong>Onyx Boox Max Lumi 2</strong>: The paper replacement e-ink tablet.<br>
As a student and researcher, I used to carry around heavy textbooks, binders full of papers and notepads everywhere. I replaced it all with the best 13-inch e-ink tablet available at the time. It matters that it is an e-ink device, since I mostly read and study with it; conventional tablets are far too distracting. Furthermore, it runs Android, which gives it much more flexibility over devices like Remarkable or a Kobo which runs highly locked down Linux.</li>
<li><strong>Lami EMR Stylus</strong>: A nice writing experience on tablets that support Wacom EMR.</li>
<li><strong>Steam Deck</strong>: The ultimate PC gaming console.<br>
I flat-out do not game on my (conventional) computers anymore. This thing can handle pretty much everything. I mean, c'mon, it runs Cyberpunk 2077! Although the console form factor makes it unsuitable for certain games that benefit from a keyboard and mouse setup, it has high extensibility which makes playing games like Frostpunk feasible as well. Unlike some other folks, I do not try to do anything other than gaming on this device. It's on darn good bang-for-buck gaming machine, and that's good enough for me.</li>
<li><strong>SFF Desktop PC</strong>: Mini-ITX Gaming PC built with recycled parts.<br>
This device is a product of a time when I wanted a gaming PC that I could take anywhere, as I used to travel quite often. Now, the Steam Deck covers that use case. The Desktop PC mostly functions as a Blender machine at the moment. If I figure out a way to run blender with high performance on my laptop (cloud render farms? eGPU?) or on the Steam Deck then I might not even replace my PC when the current one finally dies. I built it with an RTX 580 GPU and an m.2 SSD salvaged from a dead eGPU and a dead laptop, among other parts.</li>
</ul>
<p>I currently do not have a phone. I am still researching simple, small android devices.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<h4>Foundational Software</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operating System</strong>: EndeavourOS (Arch Linux)<br>
Although I love Arch Linux for its unparalled software support through the arch user repository, installing Arch from scratch is bit of a hassle, even nowadays. EndeavourOS is my favorite way to have a smooth experience on Arch with minimal setup.</li>
<li><strong>Desktop Environment</strong>: XFCE<br>
Since my Thinkpad is fairly old, more modern desktop environments such as GNOME, Budgie, and KDE run somewhat sluggishly. Among the lightweight DEs that I tested out, I liked XFCE the best for its easy GUI configuration, useful panel widgets, and a somewhat modern look and feel.</li>
<li><strong>Web Browser</strong>: Firefox<br>
There still ain't better free and open-source and fully-featured web browser, and there likely never will be a real competitor for its niche.</li>
<li><strong>Terminal Emulator</strong>: Alacritty<br>
It's fast. Whereas Gnome Terminal might have a bit of input lag on my Thinkpad, and xterm is a hassle to setup, Alacritty is snappy and pretty from the get-go.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Flatpak Packages</h4>
<p>These are mostly apps that everyone else uses, so you have no choice but to use, or do not have suitable replacements on the Arch repo or AUR.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discord</strong>: De-facto messaging app nowadays.</li>
<li><strong>Slack</strong>: Necessary for work.</li>
<li><strong>ONLYOFFICE Desktop</strong>: One of the few sensible Microsoft Office replacements on Linux.</li>
<li><strong>Flatseal</strong>: Allows flatpak apps to gain more permissions.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Command-line Apps</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shell</strong>: fish<br>
Its default config behavior is much more user-friendly than bash, with convenient features such as suggestions and autocomplete.</li>
<li><strong>Text editor</strong>: neovim + NvChad<br>
I could never get used to emacs, so vim it is. Neovim over vim any day simply due to its usage of lua rather than vimscript. NvChad is a very sensible default configuration for neovim which allows me to have a VSCode-like experience on neovim without too much hassle.</li>
<li><strong>News reader</strong>: <code>newsraft</code><br>
I found newsraft to be easy to configure, with a highly informative <code>man</code> page. It aims to be a simpler alternative to <code>newsboat</code> and I think it succeeds. I subscribe to video content creators, blogs, and podcasts.</li>
<li><strong>Document viewer</strong>: <code>zathura</code><br>
Is <code>zathura</code> a &quot;true&quot; command-line app? Probably not, though its minimal interface and vim-style navigation hotkeys certainly suit a terminal-centric workflow. My preferred way to view PDF or epub files.</li>
<li><strong>Journaling &amp; logging</strong>: <strong><code>jrnl</code></strong><br>
A simple CLI application which automates plain-text journaling. I use it as my diary, &quot;private Twitter&quot; to write down showerthoughts, to record what I accomplished in a day, to keep track of workouts, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Grammer checker</strong>: LanguageTool<br>
FOSS alternative to Grammarly that runs offline!</li>
</ul>
<h4>GUI Apps</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Code editor</strong>: VSCodium<br>
A telemetry-free fork of VSCode. Useful for projects that are large enough that it makes sense to use a modern text editor or an IDE rather than neovim.</li>
<li><strong>Media player</strong>: VLC</li>
<li><strong>File synchronization</strong>: Syncthing-GTK<br>
An easy-to-use GUI frontend for Syncthing, a blazingly-fast file synchronization daemon. Although I know how to set up Syncthing using <code>systemd</code>, I can't be bothered. I rent a VPS which acts as a central cloud storage.</li>
<li><strong>Torrenting</strong>: Transmission<br>
For downloading completely legal content such as Linux distros, of course. Although CLI alternatives exist, Transmission is intuitive and gets the job done.</li>
<li><strong>TeX Match</strong>: $\LaTeX$ symbol search</li>
<li><strong>Trimage</strong>: Lossless image compression</li>
<li><strong>3D Modelling</strong>: Blender</li>
</ul>
<h4>Web Apps</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overleaf</strong>: Cooperative $\LaTeX$ document editing<br>
Since everyone else uses it, and it allows for easier collaboration! Personally, I like to use their Git functionality to download the files offline rather than running their heavy webapp which makes my Thinkpad show its age.</li>
<li><strong>Self-hosting</strong>: Yunohost<br>
This FOSS operating system makes it dead-simple to self-host web applications on a server. Could I do everything on my own? Probably. Though there's no way I'd keep up with the necessary security patches. I have good experience with the developers' support in their forums as well.</li>
<li><strong>Reading log</strong>: Goodreads<br>
Although I tried several FOSS solutions in the past, it's really difficult to beat the extensive catalog that GoodReads has and its relatively straightforward UX at the same time.</li>
<li><strong>Jupyter Lab</strong>: Data science &amp; computer science stuff</li>
</ul>
<h3>But how do you...</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calendar</strong>: A <code>cal.md</code> file.</li>
<li><strong>Todo list</strong>: A <code>wm.md</code> (<strong>w</strong>orking <strong>m</strong>emory) file.</li>
<li><strong>Note taking</strong>: Annotating a pdf template on my tablet (handwritten notes) or some markdown files (plain text notes). Pen &amp; paper sometimes.</li>
<li><strong>Reference manager</strong>: Plain bibtex files. It's not the best solution, but I dislike Zotero for other reasons.</li>
<li><strong>Pretty much everything else</strong>: Simple nested file directories, flat files, and markdown files.</li>
</ul>
<p>A useful tool for the flat-file lifestyle is the humble <code>index.md</code> file. Essentially, it bridges the gap between folders, which stores files, and markdown files, which stores notes. Storing some files in a directory, then adding an <code>index.md</code> file to take notes about what those files are for, allows us to simulate &quot;notes with attachments&quot; a la Evernote or OneNote without relying on external software.</p>
