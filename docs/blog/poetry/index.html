            <p>I listen to a wide range of music, from rock and metal to some synthwave, hiphop and and K-pop. So while I'm not a genre purist, there is a common &quot;vibe&quot; among my favorite artists in that they put a lot of attention into the lyrics of their songs and aim to be more &quot;poetic&quot; than the norm of their genre.</p>
<p>I also like it when artists write about topics that aren't the same tired love song trope.</p>
<p>Essentially, this is the post in which I vibe to the lyricism of my favorite songs and artists.</p>
<h3>Poets of the Fall</h3>
<p>Of course, my favorite rock band of all time are self-proclaimed poets. Who else would I listen to? This alternative rock and rock ballad band is known for their songs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7OF6j5hI4I">War</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLxb7m0j5Jg">The Poet and the Muse</a> which were featured in the game <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/">Alan Wake</a>.</p>
<p>While the two Alan Wake songs are excellent, I want to highlight their lesser known classic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9vHb2WRlwI">Locking Up the Sun</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It's a bad trip on a sinking ship, when no-one seems responsible<br>
Scapegoat to rock the boat, yeah, we need someone expendable<br>
...<br>
Is there a hero somewhere, someone who appears and saves the day<br>
Someone who holds out a hand and turns back time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly, the authors are talking about how people react with societal crisis - sinking ships - in toxic ways, by either pointing their fingers to a &quot;scapegoat&quot; or blindly waiting for a &quot;hero&quot; who will fix the problems. Yet the author points out that such scapegoat or hero does not exist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And in the emptiness...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead, the only way to solve such problems is collective action.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just lookwithin yourself for absolution</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>MC Sniper</h3>
<p>MC Sniper is a relatively obscure first-generation Korean rapper from the 90s, and someone who describes himself as a lyrical poet. I like his lyrical style of singing rap and his subject matter. His songs include tired love song tropes but also includes societal issues, disasters, and the perspective of life from a 40-something-year-old solely missing from the &quot;Oh I'm so Rich and I Fuck Bitches&quot; kind of rap songs.</p>
<p>One of my favorites is Night Flight, as it exemplifie his perspective as a now middle aged family man that he didn't realize in his youth. I'll just translate a whole section which speaks for itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Time is short when in you're in love<br>
While tears are short in heartbreak<br>
Life is seeing things that you didn't see<br>
while you were in love, after the breakup</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When I was young, I counted the stars<br>
As an adult, I count only bills<br>
If I bleach the grimes in my heart<br>
will it also erase my concerns</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I see my mother's hesitation<br>
re-checking the price of the sweater<br>
She couldn't buy it with 12-month installments<br>
She kitted overnight instead</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As she had done, I so will do<br>
As life is like, I so will feel<br>
I bet my life to protect my dreams<br>
But to dream again, I must discard my dreams</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Cavetown</h3>
<p>This young pop singer has become sort of a transmasc icon. I like his song, though the song that I jam to the most is, by far, Home.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2APLh8_ExU0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>It talks about the guilt of being mentally unstable and needing special attention.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Often, I am upset that I can not fall in love, but I guess<br>
This avoids the stress of falling out of it<br>
Are you tired of me yet?<br>
I'm a little sick right now, but I swear<br>
When I'm ready, I will fly us out of here</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The struggles of learning how to perform a new role and the difficult self-discovery process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Get a load of this monster<br>
He doesn't know how to communicate<br>
His mind is in a different place<br>
Will everybody please give him a little bit of space?<br>
Get a load of this train wreck<br>
His hair's a mess and he doesn't know who he is yet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the truth that there is nothing wrong with him, and that he will find a home.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But little do we know, the stars<br>
Welcome him with open arms</p>
</blockquote>
