                            <h2>My Academic Knowledge Management Setup</h2>
                            
                            
                            <p>I've been following the personal knowledge management (PKM) space for a while now. The promises of a second brain that helps you make novel connections and organize the haphazard pile of primary, secondary and original text, is appealing to an academic like me.</p>
<p>Yet, I had trouble finding a system that works for me. <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/#the-introduction-to-the-zettelkasten-method">Zettelkasten</a> is too orthodox in its insistence of a flat hierarchy and atomic notes, as I don't really think like that. I don't have an incentive to cultivate a <a href="https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up">digital garden</a>. <a href="https://johnnydecimal.com/">Johnny Decimal</a>? Too restrictive. <a href="https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/">PARA</a> is better, though categorizing everything as either a project or an area doesn't mesh too well with my workflow.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I decided to start from scratch and assess my needs.</p>
<ol>
<li>I need a way to organize scientific literature and literature notes.</li>
<li>I want to be able to discover non-obvious connection between literature.</li>
<li>I need a way to take notes on <em>subjects</em> for studying and for future reference.</li>
<li>I need a way to take notes on <em>projects</em> that may cite multiple <em>literature notes</em> or <em>subject notes</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>To summarize, there are three fundamental types of notes I take: literature, subject, and project notes.</p>
<p>Since I need to manage hundreds of papers, I decided to use a reference manager, with my choice being goold 'ol free and open source <a href="https://zotero.org">Zotero</a>. For note-taking, I'm sticking with <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>, since I like that it uses raw markdown files for future-proofing.</p>
<p>My whole workflow looks like this; it's nothing too special. I use the Zotero <a href="https://www.zotero.org/download/">browser plugin</a> for literature collection, and Obsidian's <a href="https://github.com/hans/obsidian-citation-plugin">Citations</a> plugin for seamless Zotero integration.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/academic-pkm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The following template for literature notes works well for me. The title of the literature notes are citekeys, but I can also quick switch via a paper's title using the alias field. I can also quickly switch to the item in Zotero by clicking on the Zotero URI. In the topics field, I tag a paper by its topic and I also have a simple paper reading tracking system where I tag them as #toread or #done.</p>
<pre><code>---
alias: {title}

## Notes

&gt; A blockquote summarizing the paper in one sentence. 

* Some bullet points. 
* Blah blah. 
</code></pre>
<p>Now, I want to discuss certain factors that I designed into my systems that might not be obvious.</p>
<h2>What's Not in Obsidian</h2>
<p>Although Obsidian is an excellent tool, it can't do everything. Trying to shove everything into a centralized PKM and/or a single app is a phenomenon in the PKM space that I dislike.</p>
<p><strong>I discover literature via external sources.</strong> Manual recommendations by colleagues, email alerts, RSS feeds, and searching archives like Google Scholar, arXiv or ACM DL are much better methods of literature discovery than anything within Obsidian.</p>
<p><strong>I read papers on Zotero or as a hard copy, not on Obsidian.</strong> Zotero takes care of PDF and highlight management. Zotero is much more mature in terms of reference management &amp; PDF management than Obsidian. I can still integrate the two platforms by including a &quot;Open in Zotero&quot; link in Obsidian's literature notes.</p>
<p><strong>I only take notes related to research and academic topics on Obsidian.</strong> This is to avoid the <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/">collector's fallacy</a>. Yes, I love the idea of learning everything, but my time on Earth is limited. I'm paid to research computer science. I'm not paid to take notes about note-taking.</p>
<p><strong>I don't take meeting, lecture, conference, or math notes on Obsidian.</strong> I prefer to take physical notes for these purposes, as I tend to focus better and make better progress with math equations, arrows and diagrams. I will transfer some important tidbits of these paper notes afterwards to Obsidian.</p>
<p><strong>I don't incorporate time and task management on Obsidian.</strong> I think plain text is a horrible format for these tasks. I prefer using pen &amp; paper with the occasional help from a digital Calendar. I like the tactility and physicality. I like being able to doodle a time block without being confined to the limitations of markdown when it comes to hyper-text.</p>
<p><strong>I dont' write the final output on Obsidian.</strong> I mainly produce two types of outputs: LaTeX manuscripts and code. Overleaf is the de-facto LaTeX collaboration platform among academics. GitHub is the programmer's equivalent. Trying to shove LaTeX manuscript writing into Obsidian via a complicated pandoc setup makes no sense. Obsidian is fine for writing draft notes or snippets, though.</p>
<h2>Hierarchy of Subjects</h2>
<p>I think of <em>subjects as a hierchy, not a web</em>. I think it's so weird that the Zettelkasten people insist on a purely flat structure, when scientific papers are ategorized as a hierarchy.</p>
<p>For instance, a <a href="https://asudeh.github.io/indexlab/tutorial22.htm">paper</a> I recently read can be categorized as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Computer science → data management systems → data integration</li>
<li>Computer science → AI/ML → algorithmic fairness → fair pre-processing</li>
<li>Computer science → data mining → dataset discovery → rare dataset mining</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's another <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2013/hash/f4573fc71c731d5c362f0d7860945b88-Abstract.html">paper</a> as an example.</p>
<ol>
<li>Computer science → algorithms → randomized algorithms → multi-armed bandits</li>
<li>Computer science → algorithms → NP-hard problems → submodular maximization → adaptive submodular maximization</li>
<li>Computer science → AI/ML → active learning</li>
</ol>
<p>My point is that <strong>the most sensible way to link a literature note with subject(s) is by tagging it with one or more hierarchical topics</strong>. The granularity of this tree of topics depends on my investment in each subject. For subjects that I only occasionally read about, such as history, a single layer of categorization may be necessary. For computer science, some of my categories are half a dozen levels deep.</p>
<p>Finally, you do not have to stick to an &quot;official&quot; categorization system like ACM's Computing Categorization System (CCS). It is a <em>flexible</em> hierarchy, where tailoring the tree to your needs and refactoring the tree is encouraged. For instance, I categorize the topic of &quot;algorithmic fairness&quot; right below &quot;computer science&quot; even though nobody (ACM, IEEE, arXiv...) does that in an official archive.</p>
<p>Obsidian supports hierarchical tags. Unfortunately, a <em>tag note</em> doesn't exist. If I tag a paper with <code>#CS/AIML/active-learning</code>, then I can't take notes about active learning in general. The solution I came up with is to use the <a href="https://github.com/aidenlx/alx-folder-note">Folder Notes</a> plugin. Since folders are inherently hierarchical, it makes sense to nest topics in a folder structure. Folder Notes streamline the process of taking notes <em>about a folder.</em></p>
<p>I configured the Folder Notes plugin such that it automatically inserts a waypoint template when a new folder note is created.</p>
<pre><code>## Waypoint
%% Waypoint %%
</code></pre>
<p>This uses the <a href="https://github.com/IdreesInc/Waypoint">Waypoint</a> plugin to create a list of child notes. For instance, my &quot;computer science&quot; folder note has the following waypoint.</p>
<ul>
<li><u>AI &amp; ML</u></li>
<li><u>algorithmic fairness</u></li>
<li><u>algorithms</u></li>
<li><u>data management</u></li>
<li><u>data mining</u></li>
<li><u>data visualization</u></li>
<li><u>programming language</u></li>
<li><u>visual computing</u></li>
</ul>
<p>The &quot;data management&quot; note has the following waypoint.</p>
<ul>
<li><u>big data</u></li>
<li><u>biomedical data management</u></li>
<li><u>data integration</u></li>
<li><u>relational database</u></li>
</ul>
<p>Waypoints make it easier to navigate my fairly large tree of topics. Typically, a single refernce is related to one to three topics. If I'm studying a particular topic, or doing a literature survey on a subject, then I take detailed subject notes on the appropriate folder note.</p>
<p>This system also helps with discoverability. By tagging each literature to multiple topics, I can discover connections that I otherwise may not have made by using the backlinks feature on Obsidian. &quot;Oh right, that paper also uses this algorithm to solve a completely different problem! I should review my notes for that paper to remind myself what the authors did.&quot;</p>
<h2>Takeaways</h2>
<p>The concept of a PKM isn't inherently life-saving nor terrible. It's just a tool that could be useful. It's easy to make mistakes due to the passionate ferver around the topic. My tips are as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Assess your needs; find the simplest system that best accomplishes your needs.</li>
<li>It's good to have many aspects of your knowledge work or life stay outside of your PKM.</li>
<li>Hierarchical folder notes might be a good middle ground between purely flat Zettelkasten and a prescriptive system where an item must belong to a <em>single</em> folder.</li>
