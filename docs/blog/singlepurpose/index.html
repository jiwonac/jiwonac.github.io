                            <p>Are our smart devices the ultimate minimalist dream? After all, a single smartphone can replace notepads, books, a compass, maps, an mp3 player, a TV, a remote control, a grocery list, a camera, a landline, and many more. Smartphones are, indeed, the ultimate Swiss army knife.</p>
<p>I realize, though, that much like a Swiss army knife, a smartphone is best treated as a collection of niche tools. For any task that we spend much of our time in, the distractability of the internet's allure at my fingertips proves to be too much.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, the task of checking time. Since I need to do it frequently, relying on my smartphone to keep myself on schedule is like using a sledgehammer to clip my nails, 40 times a day. A simple wristwatch gives me the freedom to put my phone away, which greatly helps with my distractability.</p>
<p>Another type of task for which I prefer a single-purpose device is any task that requires my full focus. For reading and note-taking, I rely heavily on an e-ink tablet.<sup>1</sup> Although it <em>can</em> be used to run any Android app, Youtube is surely less enticing in black-and-white at 10 fps!</p>
<p>Another such task is gaming.<sup>2</sup> Gaming on a Steam Deck makes me get much more immersed in the game than playing on a PC. When I play on a PC, I often have a Twitch stream running in the background while also browsing Reddit. This maximalist approach ironically minimizes the joy of gaming.</p>
<p>With these delegations, and a ruthless pruning of apps from my phone, my phone has become a Swiss army knife for a few tasks that absolutely require a phone. Such few tasks include 2-factor authentication, making phone calls, texting, navigation, and calling Uber.</p>
<p>I own many more smart devices now than I did some years ago: phone, laptop, PC, tablet, and gaming console. And yet, by turning my phone, tablet, and gaming console into single-purposes machines, I feel less cluttered and distracted than before.</p>
