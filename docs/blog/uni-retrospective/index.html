            <p>I just got my bachelor's degree! It was a long journey, including a semester when I only got F's. It's a miracle I got a degree at all, let alone with the opportunity to pursue a PhD next fall. Rather than writing an overly long retrospective that nobody cares about, I wrote a listicle instead!</p>
<h3>Five Life Lessons I Wish I Knew Before Going to College</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Take care of your mental health.</strong> If our mind breaks, then nothing else matters.</li>
<li><strong>Be okay with not being the best.</strong> Get used to the fact that you are not the best at everything you do, and that it's totally okay. That just means there's always people to learn from.</li>
<li><strong>It's not too late.</strong> Calm down! Don't rush or give up just because you're a couple of years behind others.</li>
<li><strong>There are more resources than you think.</strong> Make better use of office hours, mailing lists, student services, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Don't overextend.</strong> Take the recommended amount of courses, take on only a few extracurriculars, and do them well.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Ten Most Important Computer Science Concepts From Undergrad (In No Particular Order)</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Von Neumann architecture.</strong> The de facto computing architecture with a processing unit, control unit, memory (data + instructions), and I/O.</li>
<li><strong>The Big-O Notation.</strong> As computing problems often have massive problem sizes, asymptotic order of growth matters more than constant coefficients.</li>
<li><strong>Complexity Classes.</strong> Computing problems can be classified into different time and space complexity classes using the Big-O notation. Get used to P, NP, and DTIME.</li>
<li><strong>The Church-Turing Thesis.</strong> Wish some handwaving, the Church-Turing thesis posits that all feasible algorithms can be written as Turing's Turing Machines as well as Alonzo Church's Lambda Calculus.</li>
<li><strong>Locality.</strong> Memory locations that are spatially closer together tend to be accessed by a program closer together in time. Exploiting locality is one of the biggest systems-level optimizations.</li>
<li><strong>Abstract data structures VS concrete data structures.</strong> Lists, sets, queues, stacks, trees, graphs, and maps are abstract data structures that store data in a structured way to ease computation. Linked lists, array lists, hash tables, adjacency matrices, and sparse vectors are some ways to implement the abstract data structures.</li>
<li><strong>Abstraction.</strong> Computers are absurdly powerful and complex. As such, we organize them into layers of abstractions such that a single person only has to deal with one layer at a time.</li>
<li><strong>Reductions.</strong> Reductions allow us to transform one problem into another problem. By solving one theoretical problem, we can solve many others at the same time.</li>
<li><strong>The time-space tradeoff.</strong> In many scenarios, computer scientists make difficult problems feasible to solve within a reasonable amount of time by using more space (memory &amp; storage), which tends to be cheaper than time.</li>
<li><strong>Different fields view the same problem in different lenses.</strong> Computer science includes subdisciplines whose practitioners think in wildly different ways, such as theory (algorithms &amp; analysis), systems (empirical experiments), HCI (human factor), and data science (statistics).</li>
</ol>
<p>Many honorable mentions goes to: The greedy heuristic; search algorithms; minimax; finite automata, regular expressions and context-free grammar; duality; recursion; instructions as data; backpropagation; metaheuristics; the equivalence of logic, category theory and type theory; P vs NP problem.</p>
