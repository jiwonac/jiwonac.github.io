            <p>In the next few weeks, I will be sharing small strategies that helps my disorganized, lazy, forgetful, impulsive self to survive and thrive in a high-pressure adulting environment.</p>
<p>Speaking of forgetfulness, I was that kid who lost their phone every semester. I would lose my keys even more often. I would get late grade penalties for homework I finished on time from forgetting to submit them. I even forgot to bring a calculator to my AP Physics exam! (Somehow, I managed to do all decimal calculations by hand.)</p>
<p>Dad told me that I just didn't care enough about money. But of course I cared. Of course I wanted to stop losing things. People would tell me to double check before leaving a spot. The problem is, I would forget to double check as well.</p>
<p>The <strong>first survival strategy</strong> is to <em>tie small things to big things</em> to prevent losing them.</p>
<p>This ensures that we don't lose small essential items with no dilligence needed on our part.</p>
<p>As an example, I would forget to wear my watch after taking them off for the night or during shower. To minimize the chances of that happening, I got into the habit of wearing my watch to sleep, tying the watch to my body.</p>
<p>Another example: I use a carabinder to secure my keychain to the bag while allowing for removal when necessary. The keychain <em>always</em> goes back to the backpack after use.</p>
<p>Similarly, a phone can be tied to your body or backpack using a lanyard; Yubikey nano can be plugged into a laptop; pen can be clipped to a notebook.</p>
<p>Even if an item is too large to be physically tied to something else, I strive to put it back on or in something bigger which signifies the context.</p>
<p>For instance, I always hang my bike lock and my bike helmet on the bike itself. I've gone days unable to find my helmet after I lazily tossed it elsewhere! I also strive to put my every day carry items back inside the backpack after use. Otherwise, it will certainly get lost.</p>
