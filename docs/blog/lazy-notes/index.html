            <p>A phenomenon I see in the personal knowledge management (PKM) space is people obsessing over how they manage their notes.</p>
<p>Truth is, notes are only useful when they help us get stuff done.</p>
<ul>
<li>Notes can help us retrieve information.</li>
<li>The process of writing a note can help us make sense of complex topic.</li>
<li>Notes serve as rough drafts of the final product.</li>
<li>Notes can help us get organized on a daily basis.</li>
</ul>
<p>For none of these use cases is there a requirement to be meticulous and consistent in the ways we organize our notes.</p>
<p>Much like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation">lazy evaluator</a> which defers expensive computation until it is needed, note-taking should be done lazily until eager effort is needed.</p>
<ol>
<li>Take notes lazily when a need arises.</li>
<li>Add structure lazily when a need arises.</li>
</ol>
<p>Rule 1 prevents us from taking notes unnecessarily. Rule 2 prevents us from tweaking the setup unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Let us have a look at some of my notes to illustrate my point.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/cauchy.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I don't take notes on topics just because I just learned it.</p>
<p>I take notes on topics if I had a hard time figuring out some details (the reason <em>why</em> Cauchy criterion is more useful than basic convergence definition), or if I can add my &quot;original&quot; thought to it (equivalent definitions that I worked out as an exercise).</p>
<p>Some notes like this are atomic. Others are giant documents. It's okay to be inconsistent and lazy about the atomicity of notes.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/literature-note.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If and only if I take repeated notes of a similar structure, will I formalize the structure.</p>
<p>Literature notes is a useful structure since I read and cite a lot of papers.</p>
<p>Notice the use of grammatically incorrect sentences and symbols as a visual shorthand for words (e.g. $\exists$) to expedite writing &amp; reading.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/k-means.png" alt=""><br>
<img src="/assets/blog/k-means-2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Some notes exist on their own without being linked to other notes.</p>
<p>This note is about an experiment I ran to understand the behavior of clustering algorithms.</p>
<p>You don't have to link every note with every other note.</p>
<p>You don't have to recreate wikipedia.</p>
<p>I didn't create wikilinks to concepts like k-means clustering since I don't have a use for notes like that.</p>
<p>If I wanted to review some facts about k-means clustering, I could just look up wikipedia.</p>
<p>This experiment is mine, and the interpretation of this experiment is mine. I can't google it. As such, I lazily create a note for it.</p>
<p>I make use of bullet points with succint sentences. No one else has to understand this note. There's no point in polishing notes.</p>
<p>There are typos, and honestly, who cares?</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/question.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If a note doesn't have to be long, then I keep it short.</p>
<p>This note records a question I had when studying mathematics.</p>
<p>Since the title is enough context to remember my original question, I simply tag the note as #question and call it a day.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/wsl.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You don't have to recreate the documentation.</p>
<p>You can just link to the documentation page, or the Stack Overflow page, as needed.</p>
<p>Only when Googling again will be a headache or take way more time than the time it takes to note it down, do I take notes on documentation.</p>
