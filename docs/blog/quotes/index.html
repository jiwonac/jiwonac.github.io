In a wide, wide world, full of unimaginable numbers of people, I wasâ€”in addition to being small and insufficientâ€”special.â€¦ [My] first scientific discovery shone, as even the cheapest plastic toy does when it is new."</i><br>- Hope Jahren (Lab Girl)

  <i>"There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved."</i><br>- Charles Darwin (On the Origin of Species)
