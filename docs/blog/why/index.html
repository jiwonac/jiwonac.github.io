            <p>I have a bit of a history with existential questions. having long since struggled with the void that one must face once worldly desires are met. I have been fortunate enough to not have to worry about my survival, and, thanks to my education, not worry too much about employment or wages. I have achieved things that my peers strive towards, like a 4.0 GPA and recognition for my craft. I have experienced a relationship and know it's not the fairy tails that adults like to portray it as to young people.</p>
<p>Yet, even in my worst days where I don't see the point of it all, one thing makes me move: a friend in need. They will motivate me to extraordinary feats unexpected of a depressed person. It is to reciprocate the help that they have given me.</p>
<p>If I reframe my daily actions as helping those I care about, then it makes everything easier.</p>
<p>I am not doing homework for the sake of graduating with a college degree to get a job. (That's such a depressing outlook! How do people live like that?) I am getting my obligations done so that I can help others learn. Furthermore, by getting my work done, I am improving my ability to be more independent and therefore be more able to help others. In that sense, it is my obligation, as a young person, to help myself so that I can later help others.</p>
<p>I am not exploiting someone of their hard-earned money by providing a tutoring service. I am helping a student acquire the joy of learning and open up more opportunities in their life - at a reasonable price compared to the competition. (In an interesting irony, the fact that I care about not exploiting others in itself proves that I am not a complete nihilist.)</p>
<p>The mere act of talking with my family, spending time with them, and appreciating their hard work is helping them with their daily life.</p>
<p>The simple act of being a more functioning person helps inspire similar actions among those around me, creating a positive and constructive atmosphere. It's not selfish, therefore, to help myself.</p>
<p>From this framework, every single action is ultimately for the sake of mutual help. And, since it is the only remotely meaningful thing I could think of, it is the perspective that I much needed to get through the daily grind.</p>
