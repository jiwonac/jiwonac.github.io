                            <h2>On Old Things</h2>
                            
                            
                            <p>Some time ago, I dropped my Macbook Pro into water, causing unrepairable damage. I am on a tight budget, so I bought a $200 refurbished Thinkpad off of Amazon which was all I could afford.</p>
<p>I installed a minimal Linux distro, and threw on the lightweight XFCE desktop environment. It does everything I need to do. I can watch videos, browse the web, write documents, and do some programming. I can even run demanding software by SSHing into a server that does the heavy lifting.</p>
<p>The laptop is objectively slow by modern standards. It stutters with GNOME or KDE. It can't handle 3D rendering or gaming. Yet I love this thing. It's a slow device, but it's <em>my</em> slow device. I have an intimate knowledge of its capabilities and its limitations. I tinkered to make it run well.</p>
<p>I feel the same way towards my bike. I bought it used on Craigslist for 150 bucks. For another 100, I got it all fixed up. It's old, and some gear shifts aren't the smoothest. It still gets me from point A to point B and for 250 dollars though. In total, I paid half of a Costco bike. Even better, I'm not producing more demand for cheaply produced goods like buying a Costco bike would.</p>
<p>Getting old things to work is really fulfilling, and it sucks when I can't. A bag with a lovely design that I used for half a decade fell apart and I couldn't fix it.</p>
<p>You really don't need the latest and the greatest. There are so many product categories that are mature by this point so upgrading frequently doesn't make much sense.</p>
<p>Using old things gives me a feeling of contentment, of true ownership and understanding how the object works. The sustainability and financial upsides are quite nice as well. For me, it is a big way that I live my life simply.</p>
