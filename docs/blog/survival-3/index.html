            <p>The third survival tip is the notion that <strong>there are no rules.</strong> You're the adult now. You make your own rules. You're now old enough to be part of the rules-making process.</p>
<p>All rules that you grew up with? Someone just, like, came up with it. Everyone's figuring things out as they go, quite often via trial and error.</p>
<p>So you can let go of the rules that you grew up with. You can stop doing the things that you do just because you think you're supposed to. <small>(Within legality, blah blah.)</small></p>
<p>You don't <em>have to</em> fold the laundry.</p>
<p>You don't <em>have to</em> eat breakfast every day.</p>
<p>You don't <em>have to</em> follow arbitrary traditions.</p>
<p>You don't <em>have to</em> engage in elaborate social rituals.</p>
<p>It's okay, let them go. You might feel freer.</p>
