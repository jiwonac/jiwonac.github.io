          <title>My Favorite Quotes</title>
          <link>https://jiwonc.net/blog/quotes/</link>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;🪴 This page is a garden that I update over time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&quot;I was the only person in an infinite exploding universe who knew that this powder was made of opal. In a wide, wide world, full of unimaginable numbers of people, I was—in addition to being small and insufficient—special.… [My] first scientific discovery shone, as even the cheapest plastic toy does when it is new.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Hope Jahren (Lab Girl)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&quot;These are young people floating between identities, but their affections never change. It exists beyond gender, beyond sexuality. Something incredibly high order.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Pause and Select (Hourou Musuko and Love)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&quot;I thought about our Earth that we irreversibly intervened in, yet must continue to live on. I thought about the people who decides to rebuild when faced with an utterly unlovable world.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Kim Cho-Yeop (Garden at the End of the Earth)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&quot;I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Richard Feynman
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&quot;There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Charles Darwin (On the Origin of Species)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Physical bookstores have that magic of picking up random books that I never would have found from an online review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found several gems on this haul for about $10 total.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Adult Survival #4: Separate Digital and Analog Workspace</title>
          <link>https://jiwonc.net/blog/survival-4/</link>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;My newly furnished home office, where I spend much of my workdays, has two tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The small table to the left is the computer desk. I keep the surface clear of anything except keyboard and mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The large table to the right is the designated analog workspace. It has my index cards, books, pile of papers, a bookstand, scrap paper, and a printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the tables are positioned opposite to each other, I am not distracted by my computer in the corner of my field of vision when working offline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend other WFH academics to separate digital and analog workspaces.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Adult Survival #3: There Are No Rules</title>
          <link>https://jiwonc.net/blog/survival-3/</link>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;The third survival tip is the notion that &lt;strong&gt;there are no rules.&lt;/strong&gt; You&#39;re the adult now. You make your own rules. You&#39;re now old enough to be part of the rules-making process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All rules that you grew up with? Someone just, like, came up with it. Everyone&#39;s figuring things out as they go, quite often via trial and error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you can let go of the rules that you grew up with. You can stop doing the things that you do just because you think you&#39;re supposed to. &lt;small&gt;(Within legality, blah blah.)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&#39;t &lt;em&gt;have to&lt;/em&gt; fold the laundry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&#39;t &lt;em&gt;have to&lt;/em&gt; eat breakfast every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&#39;t &lt;em&gt;have to&lt;/em&gt; follow arbitrary traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&#39;t &lt;em&gt;have to&lt;/em&gt; engage in elaborate social rituals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s okay, let them go. You might feel freer.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Adult Survival #2: Offline Tools &gt; Desktop Web Apps &gt; Web Browser &gt; Mobile Apps</title>
          <link>https://jiwonc.net/blog/survival-2/</link>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re as prone to addictions as I am, then you&#39;ve certainly spent many days and nights doomscrolling or going on an online research spree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;second survival strategy&lt;/strong&gt; is to follow the flowchart: &lt;strong&gt;offline tools &amp;gt; online desktop apps &amp;gt; web browser &amp;gt; mobile apps.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobile apps&lt;/strong&gt; are the worst since they are meticulously designed to maximize eyeball hours and minimize barrier to spending money. Only use if necessary for survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web browsers&lt;/strong&gt; promote a bit more intentionality, but it is still very easy to fall into a rabbit hole of Youtube binges or online research sprees. Minimize time spent on a general-purpose web browser at all costs. Do NOT open up a web browser first thing in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I even uninstall my web browser during long focus sessions, then reinstall later. This is easy on Linux, but not on Windows or macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desktop wrappers&lt;/strong&gt; for web apps are a bit better, since they do not allow you to open up any website instantly. Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.gnome.org/Calendar/&quot;&gt;desktop calendar app&lt;/a&gt; instead of Google Calendar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a text file or a locally stored word document instead of Google Sheets or Microsoft Office Online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://todoist.com/downloads&quot;&gt;Todoist Desktop&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://ticktick.com/about/download&quot;&gt;Ticktick Desktop&lt;/a&gt; for task management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Discord app instead of &lt;a href=&quot;http://discord.com/&quot;&gt;discord.com&lt;/a&gt;; use Slack app instead of &lt;a href=&quot;http://slack.com/&quot;&gt;slack.com&lt;/a&gt;; etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://desktop.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Desktop&lt;/a&gt; instead of &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/&quot;&gt;github.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a desktop email client instead of web Gmail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a web app doesn&#39;t have a pre-existing desktop wrapper, then you can create one using tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/linuxmint/webapp-manager&quot;&gt;Webapp Manager&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://webcatalog.io/&quot;&gt;WebCatalog&lt;/a&gt;. Web apps created in this manner are still a web browser under the hood, but they hide UI elements that make it super easy to jump to any website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entirely offline alternatives&lt;/strong&gt; are even better than desktop apps that still need some internet connection. These apps allow me to go completely offline. Here are some suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download Wikipedia (roughly 100Gb) using &lt;a href=&quot;https://kiwix.org/&quot;&gt;Kiwix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download programming language documentations using &lt;a href=&quot;https://zealdocs.org/&quot;&gt;Zeal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download reading materials then send it to an e-reader or print them out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download music locally; you can buy DRM-free music from &lt;a href=&quot;https://bandcamp.com/&quot;&gt;Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/MP3-Music-Download/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=163856011&quot;&gt;Amazon Digital Music&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write LaTeX documents locally using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Git_Integration_and_GitHub_Synchronization&quot;&gt;Overleaf Git integration&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.texstudio.org/&quot;&gt;desktop editor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop software locally when possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy physical copies of reference books.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn how to read man pages and consider using &lt;a href=&quot;https://tldr.sh/&quot;&gt;tldr.sh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

          <title>Adult Survival #1: Tie Small Things to Big Things</title>
          <link>https://jiwonc.net/blog/survival-1/</link>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;In the next few weeks, I will be sharing small strategies that helps my disorganized, lazy, forgetful, impulsive self to survive and thrive in a high-pressure adulting environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of forgetfulness, I was that kid who lost their phone every semester. I would lose my keys even more often. I would get late grade penalties for homework I finished on time from forgetting to submit them. I even forgot to bring a calculator to my AP Physics exam! (Somehow, I managed to do all decimal calculations by hand.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad told me that I just didn&#39;t care enough about money. But of course I cared. Of course I wanted to stop losing things. People would tell me to double check before leaving a spot. The problem is, I would forget to double check as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;first survival strategy&lt;/strong&gt; is to &lt;em&gt;tie small things to big things&lt;/em&gt; to prevent losing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ensures that we don&#39;t lose small essential items with no dilligence needed on our part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, I would forget to wear my watch after taking them off for the night or during shower. To minimize the chances of that happening, I got into the habit of wearing my watch to sleep, tying the watch to my body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example: I use a carabinder to secure my keychain to the bag while allowing for removal when necessary. The keychain &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; goes back to the backpack after use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a phone can be tied to your body or backpack using a lanyard; Yubikey nano can be plugged into a laptop; pen can be clipped to a notebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if an item is too large to be physically tied to something else, I strive to put it back on or in something bigger which signifies the context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, I always hang my bike lock and my bike helmet on the bike itself. I&#39;ve gone days unable to find my helmet after I lazily tossed it elsewhere! I also strive to put my every day carry items back inside the backpack after use. Otherwise, it will certainly get lost.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>The Rules of Lazy Note-Taking</title>
          <link>https://jiwonc.net/blog/lazy-notes/</link>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A phenomenon I see in the personal knowledge management (PKM) space is people obsessing over how they manage their notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth is, notes are only useful when they help us get stuff done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notes can help us retrieve information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The process of writing a note can help us make sense of complex topic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notes serve as rough drafts of the final product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notes can help us get organized on a daily basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For none of these use cases is there a requirement to be meticulous and consistent in the ways we organize our notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation&quot;&gt;lazy evaluator&lt;/a&gt; which defers expensive computation until it is needed, note-taking should be done lazily until eager effort is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take notes lazily when a need arises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add structure lazily when a need arises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rule 1 prevents us from taking notes unnecessarily. Rule 2 prevents us from tweaking the setup unnecessarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us have a look at some of my notes to illustrate my point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jiwonc.net/assets/blog/cauchy.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t take notes on topics just because I just learned it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take notes on topics if I had a hard time figuring out some details (the reason &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; Cauchy criterion is more useful than basic convergence definition), or if I can add my &amp;quot;original&amp;quot; thought to it (equivalent definitions that I worked out as an exercise).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some notes like this are atomic. Others are giant documents. It&#39;s okay to be inconsistent and lazy about the atomicity of notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jiwonc.net/assets/blog/literature-note.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If and only if I take repeated notes of a similar structure, will I formalize the structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Literature notes is a useful structure since I read and cite a lot of papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the use of grammatically incorrect sentences and symbols as a visual shorthand for words (e.g. $&#92;exists$) to expedite writing &amp;amp; reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jiwonc.net/assets/blog/k-means.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jiwonc.net/assets/blog/k-means-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some notes exist on their own without being linked to other notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This note is about an experiment I ran to understand the behavior of clustering algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&#39;t have to link every note with every other note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&#39;t have to recreate wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t create wikilinks to concepts like k-means clustering since I don&#39;t have a use for notes like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I wanted to review some facts about k-means clustering, I could just look up wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experiment is mine, and the interpretation of this experiment is mine. I can&#39;t google it. As such, I lazily create a note for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make use of bullet points with succint sentences. No one else has to understand this note. There&#39;s no point in polishing notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are typos, and honestly, who cares?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jiwonc.net/assets/blog/question.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a note doesn&#39;t have to be long, then I keep it short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This note records a question I had when studying mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the title is enough context to remember my original question, I simply tag the note as #question and call it a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jiwonc.net/assets/blog/wsl.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&#39;t have to recreate the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can just link to the documentation page, or the Stack Overflow page, as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only when Googling again will be a headache or take way more time than the time it takes to note it down, do I take notes on documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>The Two Coupons, Generic Quota Coupon Collector&#39;s Problem</title>
          <link>https://jiwonc.net/blog/coupcoll-brown-ross/</link>
          <description>&lt;h3&gt;Coupon Collector&#39;s Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classic coupon collector&#39;s problem asks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are $n$ distinct coupons, and we wish to collect each coupon at least once. We may draw a random coupon uniformly in each iteration. How many iteration does it take, in expectation, to complete a full collection?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem attracted significant attention over the years, since many stochastic situations can be modelled as the coupon collector&#39;s problem or one of its variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now well-known that $&#92;mathbb{E}[T] = n &#92;cdot H_n &#92;approx n&#92;log n$ where $T$ is the time steps required to complete the collection, and $H_n$ is the $n$&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_number&quot;&gt;harmonic number&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Two Coupons, Generic Quota Coupon Collector&#39;s Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I took interest in one of many generalized versions of the coupon collector&#39;s problem, which is as stated below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose there are two distinct coupons. In each iteration, the probability of sampling type-1 coupon is $p$ and that for type-2 coupon is $q = 1 - p$. Our goal is to collect at least $k$ of type-1 and $r$ of type-2. How many iterations does it take, in expectation, to complete a full collection?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown and Ross&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; addressed this and related problems in 2015. Let $N_{k,r}$ be the time it takes to complete our collection. The summary of their result is&lt;br /&gt;
$$&#92;mathbb{E}[N_{k,r}] = &#92;frac{k}{q} + &#92;sum_{j=0}^{k-1}&#92;frac{r-j}{p}{k + j - 1 &#92;choose j}p^rq^j,$$&lt;br /&gt;
a relatively nice analytical equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown and Ross, being mathematicians, thought this problem trivial and did not show the steps required to achieve this expression. Since I am a mathematical dunce compared to them, I would have liked a detailed explanation! Such explanation doesn&#39;t seem to exist. So in this post I&#39;ll explain every step to replicate their result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Derivation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We split all possible outcomes into a series of infinite disjoint events. Event $&#92;mathcal{E}_j$ is the event in which $j$ copies of type-2 coupon is found by the time $k$ type-1 coupons are found. Clearly, all possible outomes fall into event $&#92;mathcal{E}_j$ for some $j &#92;ge 0$. Thus,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$&#92;mathbb{E}[N_{k,r}] = &#92;sum_{j=0}^{&#92;infty} (&#92;text{expected cost given } &#92;mathcal{E}_j) &#92;cdot &#92;mathbb{P}[&#92;mathcal{E}_j].$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Part I&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s find expressions for the two terms. The left term is easy. If we collected $k$ type-1 coupons and $j$ type-2 coupons, we only have to collect $&#92;mathrm{max}(0, r - j)$ more type-2 coupons. This remaining task takes $&#92;mathrm{max}(0, r - j)/q$ iterations in expectation. As such, total expected cost given $&#92;mathcal{E}_j$ is $k + j + &#92;mathrm{max}(0, r - j)/q$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right term is trickier. So far, we have collected $k$ type-1 coupons and $j$ type-2 coupons in $k + j$ iterations. Of all iterations, the last iteration is fixed: it must always be type-1. (Otherwise, we would not be in event $&#92;mathcal{E}_j$.) All other iterations could have been either a type-1 coupon or a type-2 coupon, with corresponding probabilities. This situation is essentially a binomial trial, where there are $k + j - 1$ total iterations and a success probability $q$. And the probability that we&#39;re looking for is $&#92;mathbb{P}[Bin(k + j - 1, q) = j]$ times $p$ since the last iteration had to be type-1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining the two terms, we get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$&#92;mathbb{E}[N_{k,r}] = &#92;sum_{j=0}^{&#92;infty} &#92;left(k + j + &#92;frac{&#92;mathrm{max}(0, r - j)}{q}&#92;right) &#92;cdot &#92;mathbb{P}[Bin(k + j - 1, q) = j] &#92;cdot p.$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substitute the binomial equation: $&#92;mathbb{P}[Bin(n, p) = k] = {n &#92;choose k} p^k q^{n - k}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$&#92;mathbb{E}[N_{k,r}] = &#92;sum_{j=0}^{&#92;infty} &#92;left(k + j + &#92;frac{&#92;mathrm{max}(0, r - j)}{q}&#92;right) &#92;cdot {k + j - 1 &#92;choose  j} p^k q^j.$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Split the left term into two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$&#92;mathbb{E}[N_{k,r}] = &#92;sum_{j=0}^{&#92;infty} (k + j) {k + j - 1 &#92;choose  j} p^k q^j + &#92;sum_{j=0}^{&#92;infty} &#92;left(&#92;frac{&#92;mathrm{max}(0, r - j)}{q}&#92;right) {k + j - 1 &#92;choose  j} p^k q^j$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left term represents the expected number of iterations required to collect $k$ copies of type-1 coupon. The right term represents the expected number of iterations required to collect the remaining type-1 coupons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Part II&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An easy way to simplify the left term is to assert that the expected number of iterations required to collect $k$ copies of type-1 coupons is clearly $k / p$. Let us, however, derive it from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us simplify the left term $&#92;sum_{j=0}^{&#92;infty} (k + j) {k + j - 1 &#92;choose  j} p^k q^j$ first. Since ${n &#92;choose k} = n!/k!(n-k)!$, we have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$${k + j - 1 &#92;choose j} = &#92;frac{(k + j - 1)!}{j! (k - 1)!}, &#92;quad {k + j &#92;choose j} = &#92;frac{(k + j)!}{j!k!}.$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, $(k + j) {k + j - 1 &#92;choose j} = k {k + j &#92;choose j}$, and the term simplifies to $k&#92;sum_{j=0}^{&#92;infty}{k + j &#92;choose j} p^k q^j$. As explained in [2], $&#92;sum_{j=0}^{&#92;infty}{k + j &#92;choose j} p^k q^j = 1/p$. Thus, the left term is $k/p$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Part III&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ugliest part of the right term is the $&#92;mathrm{max}$ operator. Notice that when $j &#92;ge r$, the entire right term becomes zero. Thus, we can get rid of the $&#92;mathrm{max}$ operator by summing from $j = 0$ to $r - 1$ instead of all the way to $&#92;infty$. Thus, the right term is simplified as&lt;br /&gt;
$$&#92;sum_{j=0}^{r - 1} &#92;left(&#92;frac{r-j}{q}&#92;right) {k + j - 1 &#92;choose  j} p^k q^j.$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bringing both Part II and part III together, we obtain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$&#92;mathbb{E}[N_{k,r}] = &#92;frac{k}{p} + &#92;sum_{j=0}^{r - 1} &#92;left(&#92;frac{r-j}{q}&#92;right) {k + j - 1 &#92;choose  j} p^k q^j.$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By symmetry,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$&#92;mathbb{E}[N_{k,r}] = &#92;frac{r}{p} + &#92;sum_{j=0}^{k - 1} &#92;left(&#92;frac{k-j}{q}&#92;right) {r + j - 1 &#92;choose  j} p^j q^r.$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--#### Part IV

One nagging question remains: How do we show that $&#92;sum_{j=0}^{&#92;infty}{k + j &#92;choose j} p^k q^j = 1/p$? I&#39;ll follow the arguments of [2] with more explanation. First, we sum from $n = j$ to $&#92;infty$ instead of $j = 0$ to $&#92;infty$, to follow [2]&#39;s argument. 

$$X = &#92;sum_{j=0}^{&#92;infty}{k + j &#92;choose j} p^k q^j = &#92;sum_{n = j}^{&#92;infty} {n &#92;choose j} p^j q^{n-j}$$

A property of ${n &#92;choose k}$ is that ${n &#92;choose k} = n!/k!(n-k)! = {n &#92;choose n - k}$. Also notice that $p, j$ are constants, so $p^j$ is as well. Thus, $X = p^j &#92;sum_{n = j}^{&#92;infty} {n &#92;choose n - j} q^{n-j}$. 

At this point, we need a new technique to simplify $n &#92;choose n - j$: generalization of $n &#92;choose k$ s.t. $n$ can be negative. The definition that everyone uses for ${-n &#92;choose k}$ is 
$$
&#92;begin{align*}
    {-n &#92;choose k} &amp;= &#92;frac{-n &#92;cdot (-n - 1) &#92;cdot (-n - 2) &#92;cdots (-n - (k - 2))&#92;cdot (-n - (k - 1))}{k!}&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;
    &amp;= (-1)^k &#92;frac{n &#92;cdot (n + 1) &#92;cdot (n + 2) &#92;ldots (n + (k - 2)) &#92;cdot (n + (k - 1))}{k!}&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;
    &amp;= (-1)^k &#92;frac{(n + k - 1)!}{k! (n - 1)!}&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;
    &amp;= (-1)^k {n + k - 1 &#92;choose k}. 
&#92;end{align*}
$$

As a direct consequence, ${-j - 1 &#92;choose n - j} = {-(j + 1) &#92;choose n - j} = (-1)^{n-j} {n &#92;choose n - j}$. Conversely, ${n &#92;choose n - j} = (-1)^{n - j} {- j - 1 &#92;choose n - j}$. Thus, by substitution, 

$$X = p^j &#92;sum_{n=j}^{&#92;infty} {-j-1 &#92;choose n -j} (-1)^{n-j} q^{n-j}.$$

We see that $n - j$ is a repeated term. For simplification, substitute $n - j = l$. 

$$X = p^j &#92;sum_{l=0}^{&#92;infty}{-j - 1 &#92;choose l} (-1)^l q^l = p^j &#92;sum_{l=0}^{&#92;infty} {-j - 1 &#92;choose l} (-q)^l$$
$$X = p^j &#92;sum_{l = 0}^{&#92;infty} (-1)^l {j + l &#92;choose l} (-q)^l = p^j &#92;sum_{l = 0}^{&#92;infty} {j + l &#92;choose l} q^l$$--&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When mathematicians go from one equation to another, they are skipping entire pages worth of derivation. Darn it, mathematicians!&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Analog is Still King</title>
          <link>https://jiwonc.net/blog/analog-king/</link>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Growing up in the digital era, I&#39;ve always been fascinated by emerging technologies. I&#39;ve tried incorporating various apps and devices to organize my life and research, from zettelkasten apps and e-ink notepads to plain text. However, time and time again, I find myself reaching for the simplicity of a notebook. It seems that, for me at least, analog is still king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Out of Sight, Out of Mind.&lt;/strong&gt; One challenge I face with digital platforms is their lack of physical presence. My brain tends to work in an &amp;quot;out of sight, out of mind&amp;quot; sort of way, and I think those with clinical or subclinical ADHD can relate. A notebook serves as a tangible reminder of my tasks and ideas, which is why I always carry a small one with me, along with an analog watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nonlinear Thinking and Friction.&lt;/strong&gt; Digital tools often struggle to accommodate nonlinear thinking. A notebook provides the flexibility to sketch, work through math problems, and flip through pages to see the bigger picture. In comparison, digital apps and devices can feel clunky, with the friction of their quirks and limitations hindering the creative process. You have to wait for files to sync, troubleshoot bugs and lags, deal with imperfect palm rejection, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the hardware side, digital devices are inherently limited by their single-screen design. With a notebook, I can have tasks or notes on one page while easily referencing them as I work on something else. Plus, the physical act of writing helps me stay focused and present in my work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distraction-Free Productivity.&lt;/strong&gt; Above all, I find that using analog methods keeps me from getting distracted. No matter how much you dumb down a smartphone or a laptop, they&#39;re still too proximate to where my entertainment comes from. I get the most work done when I lock myself in a small cubby with a pen, paper, and reference books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s true that digital platforms offer better long-term searchability and longevity. However, the humble notebook&#39;s tangibility, flexibility, and distraction-free nature give it an edge over pretty much every digital tool I&#39;ve tried in most cases. It&#39;s the best todo list, calendar, journal, note-taking medium, as well as the best thinking and creative medium. I&#39;ve learned my lesson and stopped searching for the &amp;quot;perfect app.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>My Academic Knowledge Management Setup</title>
          <link>https://jiwonc.net/blog/academic-pkm/</link>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been following the personal knowledge management (PKM) space for a while now. The promises of a second brain that helps you make novel connections and organize the haphazard pile of primary, secondary and original text, is appealing to an academic like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, I had trouble finding a system that works for me. &lt;a href=&quot;https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/#the-introduction-to-the-zettelkasten-method&quot;&gt;Zettelkasten&lt;/a&gt; is too orthodox in its insistence of a flat hierarchy and atomic notes, as I don&#39;t really think like that. I don&#39;t have an incentive to cultivate a &lt;a href=&quot;https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up&quot;&gt;digital garden&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnnydecimal.com/&quot;&gt;Johnny Decimal&lt;/a&gt;? Too restrictive. &lt;a href=&quot;https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/&quot;&gt;PARA&lt;/a&gt; is better, though categorizing everything as either a project or an area doesn&#39;t mesh too well with my workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I decided to start from scratch and assess my needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I need a way to organize scientific literature and literature notes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to be able to discover non-obvious connection between literature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I need a way to take notes on &lt;em&gt;subjects&lt;/em&gt; for studying and for future reference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I need a way to take notes on &lt;em&gt;projects&lt;/em&gt; that may cite multiple &lt;em&gt;literature notes&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;subject notes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize, there are three fundamental types of notes I take: literature, subject, and project notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I need to manage hundreds of papers, I decided to use a reference manager, with my choice being goold &#39;ol free and open source &lt;a href=&quot;https://zotero.org/&quot;&gt;Zotero&lt;/a&gt;. For note-taking, I&#39;m sticking with &lt;a href=&quot;https://obsidian.md/&quot;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, since I like that it uses raw markdown files for future-proofing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My whole workflow looks like this; it&#39;s nothing too special. I use the Zotero &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zotero.org/download/&quot;&gt;browser plugin&lt;/a&gt; for literature collection, and Obsidian&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hans/obsidian-citation-plugin&quot;&gt;Citations&lt;/a&gt; plugin for seamless Zotero integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jiwonc.net/assets/blog/academic-pkm.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following template for literature notes works well for me. The title of the literature notes are citekeys, but I can also quick switch via a paper&#39;s title using the alias field. I can also quickly switch to the item in Zotero by clicking on the Zotero URI. In the topics field, I tag a paper by its topic and I also have a simple paper reading tracking system where I tag them as #toread or #done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;---

## Notes

&amp;gt; A blockquote summarizing the paper in one sentence. 

* Some bullet points. 
* Blah blah. 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I want to discuss certain factors that I designed into my systems that might not be obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&#39;s Not in Obsidian&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Obsidian is an excellent tool, it can&#39;t do everything. Trying to shove everything into a centralized PKM and/or a single app is a phenomenon in the PKM space that I dislike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I discover literature via external sources.&lt;/strong&gt; Manual recommendations by colleagues, email alerts, RSS feeds, and searching archives like Google Scholar, arXiv or ACM DL are much better methods of literature discovery than anything within Obsidian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I read papers on Zotero or as a hard copy, not on Obsidian.&lt;/strong&gt; Zotero takes care of PDF and highlight management. Zotero is much more mature in terms of reference management &amp;amp; PDF management than Obsidian. I can still integrate the two platforms by including a &amp;quot;Open in Zotero&amp;quot; link in Obsidian&#39;s literature notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I only take notes related to research and academic topics on Obsidian.&lt;/strong&gt; This is to avoid the &lt;a href=&quot;https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/&quot;&gt;collector&#39;s fallacy&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, I love the idea of learning everything, but my time on Earth is limited. I&#39;m paid to research computer science. I&#39;m not paid to take notes about note-taking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don&#39;t take meeting, lecture, conference, or math notes on Obsidian.&lt;/strong&gt; I prefer to take physical notes for these purposes, as I tend to focus better and make better progress with math equations, arrows and diagrams. I will transfer some important tidbits of these paper notes afterwards to Obsidian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don&#39;t incorporate time and task management on Obsidian.&lt;/strong&gt; I think plain text is a horrible format for these tasks. I prefer using pen &amp;amp; paper with the occasional help from a digital Calendar. I like the tactility and physicality. I like being able to doodle a time block without being confined to the limitations of markdown when it comes to hyper-text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I dont&#39; write the final output on Obsidian.&lt;/strong&gt; I mainly produce two types of outputs: LaTeX manuscripts and code. Overleaf is the de-facto LaTeX collaboration platform among academics. GitHub is the programmer&#39;s equivalent. Trying to shove LaTeX manuscript writing into Obsidian via a complicated pandoc setup makes no sense. Obsidian is fine for writing draft notes or snippets, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hierarchy of Subjects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think of &lt;em&gt;subjects as a hierchy, not a web&lt;/em&gt;. I think it&#39;s so weird that the Zettelkasten people insist on a purely flat structure, when scientific papers are ategorized as a hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://asudeh.github.io/indexlab/tutorial22.htm&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; I recently read can be categorized as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer science → data management systems → data integration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer science → AI/ML → algorithmic fairness → fair pre-processing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer science → data mining → dataset discovery → rare dataset mining&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s another &lt;a href=&quot;https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2013/hash/f4573fc71c731d5c362f0d7860945b88-Abstract.html&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; as an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer science → algorithms → randomized algorithms → multi-armed bandits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer science → algorithms → NP-hard problems → submodular maximization → adaptive submodular maximization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer science → AI/ML → active learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point is that &lt;strong&gt;the most sensible way to link a literature note with subject(s) is by tagging it with one or more hierarchical topics&lt;/strong&gt;. The granularity of this tree of topics depends on my investment in each subject. For subjects that I only occasionally read about, such as history, a single layer of categorization may be necessary. For computer science, some of my categories are half a dozen levels deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, you do not have to stick to an &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; categorization system like ACM&#39;s Computing Categorization System (CCS). It is a &lt;em&gt;flexible&lt;/em&gt; hierarchy, where tailoring the tree to your needs and refactoring the tree is encouraged. For instance, I categorize the topic of &amp;quot;algorithmic fairness&amp;quot; right below &amp;quot;computer science&amp;quot; even though nobody (ACM, IEEE, arXiv...) does that in an official archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obsidian supports hierarchical tags. Unfortunately, a &lt;em&gt;tag note&lt;/em&gt; doesn&#39;t exist. If I tag a paper with &lt;code&gt;#CS/AIML/active-learning&lt;/code&gt;, then I can&#39;t take notes about active learning in general. The solution I came up with is to use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aidenlx/alx-folder-note&quot;&gt;Folder Notes&lt;/a&gt; plugin. Since folders are inherently hierarchical, it makes sense to nest topics in a folder structure. Folder Notes streamline the process of taking notes &lt;em&gt;about a folder.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I configured the Folder Notes plugin such that it automatically inserts a waypoint template when a new folder note is created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Waypoint
%% Waypoint %%
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This uses the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/IdreesInc/Waypoint&quot;&gt;Waypoint&lt;/a&gt; plugin to create a list of child notes. For instance, my &amp;quot;computer science&amp;quot; folder note has the following waypoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;AI &amp;amp; ML&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;algorithmic fairness&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;algorithms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;data management&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;data mining&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;data visualization&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;programming language&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;visual computing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;data management&amp;quot; note has the following waypoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;big data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;biomedical data management&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;data integration&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;relational database&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waypoints make it easier to navigate my fairly large tree of topics. Typically, a single refernce is related to one to three topics. If I&#39;m studying a particular topic, or doing a literature survey on a subject, then I take detailed subject notes on the appropriate folder note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This system also helps with discoverability. By tagging each literature to multiple topics, I can discover connections that I otherwise may not have made by using the backlinks feature on Obsidian. &amp;quot;Oh right, that paper also uses this algorithm to solve a completely different problem! I should review my notes for that paper to remind myself what the authors did.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of a PKM isn&#39;t inherently life-saving nor terrible. It&#39;s just a tool that could be useful. It&#39;s easy to make mistakes due to the passionate ferver around the topic. My tips are as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assess your needs; find the simplest system that best accomplishes your needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&#39;s good to have many aspects of your knowledge work or life stay outside of your PKM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hierarchical folder notes might be a good middle ground between purely flat Zettelkasten and a prescriptive system where an item must belong to a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

          <title>Is Technology or Morality Foundational?</title>
          <link>https://jiwonc.net/blog/machine-ethics/</link>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Given recent technological breakthroughs in AI, everyone seems to be conversing about technological advancement and its societal implications. A particularly thorny topic is the ethics of popular models, which were trained on copyrighted data, and is capable of reproducing the style of human creators with much less effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this milieu, I&#39;ve been thinking about how moral principles and technology interact with each other. My current attempt at describing the interaction, without any value judgment, can be summarized as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the technology available at a time informs moral frameworks, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, &lt;em&gt;technology is more foundational than moral frameworks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My argument hinges on a few observations which, while certainly up for debate, seem like reasonable assumptions to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People tend to make decisions via habits and emotions, then use logic to justify the decision, rather than making a purely logical decision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a piece of technology proves its utility, then its adoption by people over time tends to follow the adoption curve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So as long as humans have existed, technology has always advanced, as it is the optimal strategy for an individual or a group&#39;s fitness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People tend to view whatever technology that exists when they&#39;re young as the normal state of the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Society requires young newborns to sustain themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full argument is as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Society requires young newborns to sustain themselves. As such, unless a catastrophic event occurs, human society has a tendency to continue. So as long as human society continues to exist, technology will advance, since it maximizes an individual or a group&#39;s competitive edge to adopt new technologies which provide greater utility than its precedent. As such, a new technology that provides genuine utility is first used and developed by early adopters, then rapidly spreads to most of society beyond a certain inflection point. Thus, for every single new piece of genuinely useful technology, there will be a future time point in which a new generation is born with the technology already widespread. Since people tend to view whatever technology exists when they&#39;re young as the normal state of the world, and humans&#39; decision-making is based on emotion rather than logic, their moral framework will tend to echo whichever world they perceive as normal, even if the technology may be a net negative. Therefore, that generation&#39;s moral framework will deem the specified piece of technology acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us echo another common observation: sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, these observations mean that our future generations will most likely deem technology that is absurd to us as acceptable. Furthermore, we can imagine some technologies that will exist at the consumer level in the future will be considered morally gray or unacceptable to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples in the realm of our imagination may include perpetual life, genetically removing harmful mutations from the population, machine governance, and advanced AGI which displaces almost all human jobs and creations. Heck, humans as we know it may go extinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to the difficult question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we be empathetic toward future humans, whose moral framework disregards everything we currently consider &amp;quot;human&amp;quot; as outdated nonsense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I don&#39;t know. If I knew, I would be a famous philosopher.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Jamming to Musicians I Like for their Poetic Lyrics</title>
          <link>https://jiwonc.net/blog/poetry/</link>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I listen to a wide range of music, from rock and metal to some synthwave, hiphop and and K-pop. So while I&#39;m not a genre purist, there is a common &amp;quot;vibe&amp;quot; among my favorite artists in that they put a lot of attention into the lyrics of their songs and aim to be more &amp;quot;poetic&amp;quot; than the norm of their genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also like it when artists write about topics that aren&#39;t the same tired love song trope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, this is the post in which I vibe to the lyricism of my favorite songs and artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Poets of the Fall&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, my favorite rock band of all time are self-proclaimed poets. Who else would I listen to? This alternative rock and rock ballad band is known for their songs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7OF6j5hI4I&quot;&gt;War&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLxb7m0j5Jg&quot;&gt;The Poet and the Muse&lt;/a&gt; which were featured in the game &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alanwake.com/&quot;&gt;Alan Wake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the two Alan Wake songs are excellent, I want to highlight their lesser known classic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9vHb2WRlwI&quot;&gt;Locking Up the Sun&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V9vHb2WRlwI&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a bad trip on a sinking ship, when no-one seems responsible&lt;br /&gt;
Scapegoat to rock the boat, yeah, we need someone expendable&lt;br /&gt;
...&lt;br /&gt;
Is there a hero somewhere, someone who appears and saves the day&lt;br /&gt;
Someone who holds out a hand and turns back time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the authors are talking about how people react with societal crisis - sinking ships - in toxic ways, by either pointing their fingers to a &amp;quot;scapegoat&amp;quot; or blindly waiting for a &amp;quot;hero&amp;quot; who will fix the problems. Yet the author points out that such scapegoat or hero does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the emptiness...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the only way to solve such problems is collective action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just lookwithin yourself for absolution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;MC Sniper&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MC Sniper is a relatively obscure first-generation Korean rapper from the 90s, and someone who describes himself as a lyrical poet. I like his lyrical style of singing rap and his subject matter. His songs include tired love song tropes but also includes societal issues, disasters, and the perspective of life from a 40-something-year-old solely missing from the &amp;quot;Oh I&#39;m so Rich and I Fuck Bitches&amp;quot; kind of rap songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorites is Night Flight, as it exemplifie his perspective as a now middle aged family man that he didn&#39;t realize in his youth. I&#39;ll just translate a whole section which speaks for itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zjFp-yRyhEw&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time is short when in you&#39;re in love&lt;br /&gt;
While tears are short in heartbreak&lt;br /&gt;
Life is seeing things that you didn&#39;t see&lt;br /&gt;
while you were in love, after the breakup&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was young, I counted the stars&lt;br /&gt;
As an adult, I count only bills&lt;br /&gt;
If I bleach the grimes in my heart&lt;br /&gt;
will it also erase my concerns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see my mother&#39;s hesitation&lt;br /&gt;
re-checking the price of the sweater&lt;br /&gt;
She couldn&#39;t buy it with 12-month installments&lt;br /&gt;
She kitted overnight instead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she had done, I so will do&lt;br /&gt;
As life is like, I so will feel&lt;br /&gt;
I bet my life to protect my dreams&lt;br /&gt;
But to dream again, I must discard my dreams&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cavetown&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This young pop singer has become sort of a transmasc icon. I like his song, though the song that I jam to the most is, by far, Home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2APLh8_ExU0&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It talks about the guilt of being mentally unstable and needing special attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, I am upset that I can not fall in love, but I guess&lt;br /&gt;
This avoids the stress of falling out of it&lt;br /&gt;
Are you tired of me yet?&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m a little sick right now, but I swear&lt;br /&gt;
When I&#39;m ready, I will fly us out of here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The struggles of learning how to perform a new role and the difficult self-discovery process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get a load of this monster&lt;br /&gt;
He doesn&#39;t know how to communicate&lt;br /&gt;
His mind is in a different place&lt;br /&gt;
Will everybody please give him a little bit of space?&lt;br /&gt;
Get a load of this train wreck&lt;br /&gt;
His hair&#39;s a mess and he doesn&#39;t know who he is yet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the truth that there is nothing wrong with him, and that he will find a home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But little do we know, the stars&lt;br /&gt;
Welcome him with open arms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

          <title>On Old Things</title>
          <link>https://jiwonc.net/blog/oldthings/</link>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, I dropped my Macbook Pro into water, causing unrepairable damage. I am on a tight budget, so I bought a $200 refurbished Thinkpad off of Amazon which was all I could afford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I installed a minimal Linux distro, and threw on the lightweight XFCE desktop environment. It does everything I need to do. I can watch videos, browse the web, write documents, and do some programming. I can even run demanding software by SSHing into a server that does the heavy lifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The laptop is objectively slow by modern standards. It stutters with GNOME or KDE. It can&#39;t handle 3D rendering or gaming. Yet I love this thing. It&#39;s a slow device, but it&#39;s &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; slow device. I have an intimate knowledge of its capabilities and its limitations. I tinkered to make it run well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel the same way towards my bike. I bought it used on Craigslist for 150 bucks. For another 100, I got it all fixed up. It&#39;s old, and some gear shifts aren&#39;t the smoothest. It still gets me from point A to point B and for 250 dollars though. In total, I paid half of a Costco bike. Even better, I&#39;m not producing more demand for cheaply produced goods like buying a Costco bike would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting old things to work is really fulfilling, and it sucks when I can&#39;t. A bag with a lovely design that I used for half a decade fell apart and I couldn&#39;t fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You really don&#39;t need the latest and the greatest. There are so many product categories that are mature by this point so upgrading frequently doesn&#39;t make much sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using old things gives me a feeling of contentment, of true ownership and understanding how the object works. The sustainability and financial upsides are quite nice as well. For me, it is a big way that I live my life simply.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>No Optional Websites: Month 1 Update</title>
          <link>https://jiwonc.net/blog/without-internet-1mo/</link>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A month ago, I expressed a desire to live &lt;a href=&quot;https://jiwonc.net/blog/without&quot;&gt;without&lt;/a&gt; optional websites as infinite feeds were making me feel overwhelmed. It&#39;s been a month and the experiment was largely a failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These addictive websites prey upon my lowest moments. If I am having a great day, then abstaining is easy. On the bad days, doomscrolling is a surefire drug to quell depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although most social media websites are a waste of time, my main vices Youtube and Reddit are often valuable sources of information. As such, a flat-out ban hindered my work on the good days, and I still ended up doomscrolling on the bad days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, I chose to block the hompage, r/all, and other subreddits&#39; browse page using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/less-distracting-reddit/&quot;&gt;Less Distracting Reddit&lt;/a&gt; browser extension while still allowing me to read individual posts. This allows me to use Reddit like Stack Overflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstaining from r/all, in particular, has drastically improved my mental well-being. The r/all page is a cesspool of the platform&#39;s most emotionally charged posts that inevitably makes me mad at the state of the world or the internet&#39;s villain of the day. I took the grill pill and ignored it all. I was happier for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For other websites, I will throttle internet bandwidth to 1Kbps and block images by default. These changes make web browsing much less appealing. I&#39;m allowed exceptions for work necessities. We&#39;ll see how that goes!&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>A Few Lessons from Undergrad</title>
          <link>https://jiwonc.net/blog/uni-retrospective/</link>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I just got my bachelor&#39;s degree! It was a long journey, including a semester when I only got F&#39;s. It&#39;s a miracle I got a degree at all, let alone with the opportunity to pursue a PhD next fall. Rather than writing an overly long retrospective that nobody cares about, I wrote a listicle instead!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Five Life Lessons I Wish I Knew Before Going to College&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take care of your mental health.&lt;/strong&gt; If our mind breaks, then nothing else matters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be okay with not being the best.&lt;/strong&gt; Get used to the fact that you are not the best at everything you do, and that it&#39;s totally okay. That just means there&#39;s always people to learn from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&#39;s not too late.&lt;/strong&gt; Calm down! Don&#39;t rush or give up just because you&#39;re a couple of years behind others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are more resources than you think.&lt;/strong&gt; Make better use of office hours, mailing lists, student services, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&#39;t overextend.&lt;/strong&gt; Take the recommended amount of courses, take on only a few extracurriculars, and do them well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ten Most Important Computer Science Concepts From Undergrad (In No Particular Order)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Von Neumann architecture.&lt;/strong&gt; The de facto computing architecture with a processing unit, control unit, memory (data + instructions), and I/O.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Big-O Notation.&lt;/strong&gt; As computing problems often have massive problem sizes, asymptotic order of growth matters more than constant coefficients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complexity Classes.&lt;/strong&gt; Computing problems can be classified into different time and space complexity classes using the Big-O notation. Get used to P, NP, and DTIME.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Church-Turing Thesis.&lt;/strong&gt; Wish some handwaving, the Church-Turing thesis posits that all feasible algorithms can be written as Turing&#39;s Turing Machines as well as Alonzo Church&#39;s Lambda Calculus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Locality.&lt;/strong&gt; Memory locations that are spatially closer together tend to be accessed by a program closer together in time. Exploiting locality is one of the biggest systems-level optimizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract data structures VS concrete data structures.&lt;/strong&gt; Lists, sets, queues, stacks, trees, graphs, and maps are abstract data structures that store data in a structured way to ease computation. Linked lists, array lists, hash tables, adjacency matrices, and sparse vectors are some ways to implement the abstract data structures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstraction.&lt;/strong&gt; Computers are absurdly powerful and complex. As such, we organize them into layers of abstractions such that a single person only has to deal with one layer at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reductions.&lt;/strong&gt; Reductions allow us to transform one problem into another problem. By solving one theoretical problem, we can solve many others at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The time-space tradeoff.&lt;/strong&gt; In many scenarios, computer scientists make difficult problems feasible to solve within a reasonable amount of time by using more space (memory &amp;amp; storage), which tends to be cheaper than time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Different fields view the same problem in different lenses.&lt;/strong&gt; Computer science includes subdisciplines whose practitioners think in wildly different ways, such as theory (algorithms &amp;amp; analysis), systems (empirical experiments), HCI (human factor), and data science (statistics).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many honorable mentions goes to: The greedy heuristic; search algorithms; minimax; finite automata, regular expressions and context-free grammar; duality; recursion; instructions as data; backpropagation; metaheuristics; the equivalence of logic, category theory and type theory; P vs NP problem.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Data Distribution Tailoring</title>
          <link>https://jiwonc.net/false</link>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;We study the data distribution tailoring (DT) problem, which aims to collect a unified dataset from multiple data sources such that groups of interest are adequately represented. In doing so, we ensure a baseline level of fairness in downstream tasks. We demonstrate the suboptimality of the prior paper&#39;s &lt;textsc&gt;CoupColl&lt;/textsc&gt; algorithm and present a strictly better &lt;textsc&gt;RatioColl&lt;/textsc&gt; algorithm. Furthermore, we generalize the prior authors&#39; &lt;textsc&gt;UCB&lt;/textsc&gt; algorithm for situations in which demographic statistics are not available through our &lt;textsc&gt;EpsilonGreedy&lt;textsc&gt; algorithm.&lt;/textsc&gt;&lt;/textsc&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Two Years of Living Without</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://manuelmoreale.com/&quot;&gt;Manuel Moreal&lt;/a&gt; has a series of blog posts on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://manuelmoreale.com/without&quot;&gt;year of living without&lt;/a&gt;, in which he temporarily eliminates aspects of his life to see how it goes. In a way, I&#39;ve already lived a year without in 2022, and would like to continue with this trend in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2022: A Year Without Animal Products&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022, I turned vegan. I was ethically movitated after watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGXDNuiz_dE&quot;&gt;this interview with Earthling Ed&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQRAfJyEsko&quot;&gt;Dominion&lt;/a&gt; documentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made the connection that animal exploitation is inevitable when non-human animals are treated as property, not individuals. Furthermore, the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0128092653/&quot;&gt;Conceptual Breakthroughs in Ethology and Animal Behavior&lt;/a&gt; provided scientific evidence that non-human animals possess emotions and have personalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change was swift, and surprisingly easy. Upon changing my mind, I gave myself a short vegetarian transition period. This was during finals season, so I stocked up on vegan and vegetarian frozen meals; those bean burritos had it coming! During the transition period, I switched my meals one by one to the vegan alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned how to use nutritional yeast, make cream with cashew nuts, how to supplement nutrients, use coconut milk for fatty recipes, marinate or crisp up tofu, use bean curds, and many more techniques that I never thought of using when I was an omnivore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest upside of a vegan lifestyle, other than the alignment of my values and my actions, has been a revitalized interest and joy in cooking. Limitations bring creativity, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2023: A Year Without Optional Websites?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, I made a change on a whim that turned out to be immensely positive: I quit browsing Reddit and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was motivated by the simple reason that I felt worse after browsing these websites. While both platforms occasionally provide genuinely educational content, the political wars, the infinite flood of content™ and the almighty algorithm™&#39;s invisible hand to maximize my eyeball hours became too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like going vegan, the change was easier than expected. After a week, I found that I missed them exactly zero percent of the time. A useful technique was to be mindful of how terrible I&#39;d feel if I were to doomscroll. This experience reminds me of that research where mindfulness meditation was shown to be an effective method to quit smoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d like to continue this trend and try living without almost no optional websites in 2023. Of course, there are websites that are critical to work, such as GitHub, Slack, Overleaf, Gmail, Google Scholar...as well as government and banking sites. It would be stupid to ban those. By &amp;quot;optional&amp;quot; I mean anything else, typically serving entertainment: social media, video streaming, podcasts, blogs, and news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are my specific rules, which I am already mostly following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use local &lt;a href=&quot;https://jiwonc.net/blog/flatfile&quot;&gt;flat files&lt;/a&gt; for computing where possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zero exceptions allowed for Reddit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YouTube is okay so as long as it is for work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manually checking a small list of quality content creators is okay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web feeds - algorithmic, email newsletters, and RSS - are not okay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optional web browsing to aid socializing is okay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming healthily, as I have been, is okay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep up with the world through slow - monthly or quarterly - publications instead of the internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read books as the default replacement activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No electronics on bed or at bedtime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will update if there is a major change, and once every few months otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>The Unbearable Melancholy of the Dead Internet</title>
          <link>https://jiwonc.net/blog/deadinternet/</link>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, I stumbled upon a band. They released two albums to little fanfare, then disappeared. I wondered what had happened to its members. They were certainly passionate people. Did their musical dreams blossom at all, under different identities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&#39;t find out. I felt sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#39;t even remember the band&#39;s name anymore. Does anyone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bloggers that I used to read - how are you? Did you get a demanding job? A spouse and a kid? Perchance, a new hobby? I dearly hope you weren&#39;t hit by a car or succumbed to Alzheimer&#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors and Youtubers and podcasters who won&#39;t create anymore. I see your tweets, so I know you&#39;re doing alright. Did your interests change, or was it the world that did? Were the pests drawn to your spotlight a little too much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know that your embarassing creations meant a lot to me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if people miss me all the same. My old blog now exits only in memories. Lost from the internet, even the backup gone from a clumsy mistake. I wish I could reach my hundred followers to tell them: I really enjoyed talking to you, writing for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you searched up the blog, mused in the melancholy of loss - I hope you understand that I needed to start anew. As we all do, I have my own circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the graveyard of ancients lie a thousand-year-old documents. Yet on the internet that supposedly never forgets, only an abyss of deleted bits.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>The Flat File Lifestyle</title>
          <link>https://jiwonc.net/blog/flatfile/</link>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I&#39;ve grown increasingly wary of using any application that stores its data in a nonstandard format or in a relational database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main concern is longevity: I&#39;ve jumped apps enough times to know that most software companies or projects don&#39;t last long. If your file format isn&#39;t a popular open standard like txt, html, pdf, or png, it could break at any time. Evernote did not support Linux for a long time, so dealing with their proprietary .enex file format was a pain. The same could be said about Clip Studio&#39;s .clip file format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secondary concern is a desire to understand what is really happening with the apps that I use. Zotero, for instance, is an awesome application. However, there are often small discrepancies between what I intended and the BibTeX file that is exported in the end, due to the sqlite middleman. I decided to work directly with BibTeX files to gain fine control over the BibTeX exports. Put another way, although SQL databases are reliable for a software programmer, they are less human-readable for the end user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third factor is platform freedom. If the developers decide to add a lot of junk features, or get bought out by a scummy owner, then I can easily switch to a different app that also uses the popular, open file format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migrating to an almost flat-file-based workflow was not too difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handwritten notes: Onyx Boox notes app (sqlite database) → annotating a PDF notebook template&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typed notes: Evernote (enex, a proprietary format built on XML) → plain text markdown files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reference manager: Zotero (sqlite database) → JabRef (raw BibTeX files)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Photo management: Photos app (Apple&#39;s proprietary format) → flat image files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Office documents: Work with Microsoft or Google&#39;s file formats to collaborate → archive final product in odf (open document format) and PDF.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There certainly is a learning curve, particularly with learning the flat file format&#39;s specifications and its idiosyncrasies. At the end of the day, though, I like understanding what my data means.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Using Web Apps on the Steam Deck&#39;s Gaming Mode</title>
          <link>https://jiwonc.net/blog/webdeck/</link>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been fiddling around with my Steam Deck to turn it into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jiwonc.net/blog/singlepurpose&quot;&gt;specialized&lt;/a&gt; entertainment device, capable of gaming and media streaming. Since the Steam Deck runs on Linux, it is difficult to procure apps that were purpose-built for a streaming service, with a few exceptions. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gnome.Podcasts&quot;&gt;podcasts&lt;/a&gt; app and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.freetubeapp.FreeTube&quot;&gt;FreeTube&lt;/a&gt; app work well, though the latter is for those who want a very minimal Youtube experience without any algorithmic recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, turning a website into a desktop &amp;quot;app&amp;quot; with Chromium and adding it to Steam as a non-Steam game is the best solution. Why not just browse through the Chromium or Firefox browser? You would know if you tried, that web browsing on Gaming mode is very clunky! Encapsulating a single website as a web app improves the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a prerequisite, you should do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access the &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/671A-4453-E8D2-323C&quot;&gt;Desktop mode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;a href=&quot;https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.chromium.Chromium&quot;&gt;Chromium&lt;/a&gt; from the Discover Store.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add Chromium to Steam as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4B8B-9697-2338-40EC&quot;&gt;non-Steam game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we figure out how Chromium was added to Steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right click on Chromium in the Steam library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click &amp;quot;Properties..&amp;quot;. At the moment, the fields are as follows. Copy the launch options text for use later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target: &amp;quot;/usr/bin/flatpak&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Start in: &amp;quot;/usr/bin/&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Launch options: run --branch=stable --arch=x86 --command=/app/bin/chromium --file-forwarding org.chromium.Chromium @@u @@&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once these steps are done, navigate to the desired website and install a shortcut to it as an app by following &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/3060053?hl=en&quot;&gt;Google&#39;s documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we will examine the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/desktop_entries&quot;&gt;desktop file&lt;/a&gt; of the newly installed web app. Although you could do it on the command line or on the file browser, the following method is the simplest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on the Application Launcher (bottom left corner) and find the web app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right click (left trigger) and choose &amp;quot;Edit Application..&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate to the &amp;quot;Applications&amp;quot; tab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examine the &amp;quot;Command&amp;quot; field. Among other things, it will contain a command of the form: --app-id:agimnkijcaahngcdmfeangaknmldooml. The actual app id might differ. Copy this portion and save for use in the next step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we can add this app to Steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the application as a non-Steam game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right click on the web app in the Steam library and click &amp;quot;Properties..&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the visible fields as following:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target: &amp;quot;/usr/bin/flatpak&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Start in: &amp;quot;/usr/bin/&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Launch options: run --branch=stable --arch=x86 --command=/app/bin/chromium --file-forwarding org.chromium.Chromium @@u @@ --app-id:agimnkijcaahngcdmfeangaknmldooml.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the launch option is a combination of the launch options for Chromium we saved earlier, and the app id field that we found from the app&#39;s desktop file. I think that the --file-forwarding launch option is the critical piece for making Chromium work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the app should launch now! As optional steps, you can set some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.steamgriddb.com/&quot;&gt;custom artworks&lt;/a&gt; and enable adblocking on Chromium for a nicer experience. 😉&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Fair $k$-Cover Coresets</title>
          <link>https://jiwonc.net/false</link>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;We study the fair $k$-cover problem, which aims to efficiently obtain coresets such that 1) every point in the full dataset is covered by a point in the coreset at least $k$ times, and 2) points in the coreset adequately represent groups of interest. We solve the problem through a reduction to submodular optimization. Our $&#92;mathrm{F}&#92;mathcal{K}&#92;mathrm{C}$ coresets reduce accuracy disparity while generating coresets at a fraction of the cost as SOTA.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Single-Purpose Smart Devices</title>
          <link>https://jiwonc.net/blog/singlepurpose/</link>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Are our smart devices the ultimate minimalist dream? After all, a single smartphone can replace notepads, books, a compass, maps, an mp3 player, a TV, a remote control, a grocery list, a camera, a landline, and many more. Smartphones are, indeed, the ultimate Swiss army knife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize, though, that much like a Swiss army knife, a smartphone is best treated as a collection of niche tools. For any task that we spend much of our time in, the distractability of the internet&#39;s allure at my fingertips proves to be too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take, for instance, the task of checking time. Since I need to do it frequently, relying on my smartphone to keep myself on schedule is like using a sledgehammer to clip my nails, 40 times a day. A simple wristwatch gives me the freedom to put my phone away, which greatly helps with my distractability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another type of task for which I prefer a single-purpose device is any task that requires my full focus. For reading and note-taking, I rely heavily on an e-ink tablet.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Although it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be used to run any Android app, Youtube is surely less enticing in black-and-white at 10 fps!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another such task is gaming.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Gaming on a Steam Deck makes me get much more immersed in the game than playing on a PC. When I play on a PC, I often have a Twitch stream running in the background while also browsing Reddit. This maximalist approach ironically minimizes the joy of gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these delegations, and a ruthless pruning of apps from my phone, my phone has become a Swiss army knife for a few tasks that absolutely require a phone. Such few tasks include 2-factor authentication, making phone calls, texting, navigation, and calling Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I own many more smart devices now than I did some years ago: phone, laptop, PC, tablet, and gaming console. And yet, by turning my phone, tablet, and gaming console into single-purposes machines, I feel less cluttered and distracted than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; An Onyx Boox Max Lumi 2. The 13-inch e-ink tablet category is uncontested.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Three years ago, I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://jiwonc.net/blog/minimalgaming&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; discussing minimal gaming setup ideas. The Steam Deck trumps all options that were available back then.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>User-Controlled Recommender Systems</title>
          <link>https://jiwonc.net/blog/recommender/</link>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Algorithmic recommendations are a fact of life on the contemporary internet, from Google Searches to Youtube, Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, Amazon...the list goes on. With the omnipresence of recommender systems comes a widespread recognition of its downside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta has recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/instagram-full-screen-feed-recommended-posts-185859342.html&quot;&gt;faced backlash&lt;/a&gt; for swarming the feed of Facebook and Instagram users with accounts they do not follow. TikTok&#39;s recommendation systems &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.losangelesblade.com/2021/10/11/tiktoks-algorithm-leads-users-from-transphobic-to-far-right-rabbit-holes/&quot;&gt;funnel users into bigotry&lt;/a&gt;. The fabled Youtube Algorithm has also been subject to constant criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what if we just...gave users more control over recommender systems? Much of the complaint against algorithmic recommendations is the feeling that it is shoved down our throats. The same cookie-cutter experience is delivered to the entire userbase. Sure, some users may like an algorithmic Instagram feed, but what about the rest?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although a poorly designed panel of knobs and buttons could be a UX disaster for non-technical users, I don&#39;t think it has to be. Youtube already gives users simple control over the topic of their feed. A toggle button to set the feed to &amp;quot;tried and true&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;something adventurous&amp;quot; mode which changes the exploration rate of the recommender system could be an intuitive feature. What if we could control the length of recommended videos? Their tone? The ratio of content recommended from various sources with wildy different content output?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the far future, we may even be able to precisely specify our tastes using natural language. Imagine being able to say, &amp;quot;Hey Youtube, I would like to stop my addiction to politically divisive content&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;I don&#39;t like this Youtuber, not because of their topic matter, but because of their incessant clickbait.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, none of these are conducive to profit motives, which aim to maximize advertisement revenue beyond any other measures. User-controlled recommendation systems may be developed and disseminated through alternative frontend projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://invidious.io/&quot;&gt;Invidious&lt;/a&gt;. Or perhaps there is a legal argument - which I am not qualified to make any definitive statements about - in favor of users&#39; right to control recommendation systems. One can dream.&lt;/p&gt;

          <link>https://jiwonc.net/false</link>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Photographers can extend the perceptual dynamic range of a photograph by utilizing the exposure fusion method, in which multiple photographs taken at different exposures are combined. However, this technique is susceptible to blur if the camera or subject moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I developed an alternate SDR to HDR pipeline which only requires one medium-exposure SDR photograph and will not be blurred due to camera or subject&#39;s movement. Unlike existing alternatives, single exposure fusion is a simple combination of classic denoising and exposure fusion algorithms that does not require machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Why Should I Bother?</title>
          <link>https://jiwonc.net/blog/why/</link>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a bit of a history with existential questions. having long since struggled with the void that one must face once worldly desires are met. I have been fortunate enough to not have to worry about my survival, and, thanks to my education, not worry too much about employment or wages. I have achieved things that my peers strive towards, like a 4.0 GPA and recognition for my craft. I have experienced a relationship and know it&#39;s not the fairy tails that adults like to portray it as to young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, even in my worst days where I don&#39;t see the point of it all, one thing makes me move: a friend in need. They will motivate me to extraordinary feats unexpected of a depressed person. It is to reciprocate the help that they have given me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I reframe my daily actions as helping those I care about, then it makes everything easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not doing homework for the sake of graduating with a college degree to get a job. (That&#39;s such a depressing outlook! How do people live like that?) I am getting my obligations done so that I can help others learn. Furthermore, by getting my work done, I am improving my ability to be more independent and therefore be more able to help others. In that sense, it is my obligation, as a young person, to help myself so that I can later help others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not exploiting someone of their hard-earned money by providing a tutoring service. I am helping a student acquire the joy of learning and open up more opportunities in their life - at a reasonable price compared to the competition. (In an interesting irony, the fact that I care about not exploiting others in itself proves that I am not a complete nihilist.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mere act of talking with my family, spending time with them, and appreciating their hard work is helping them with their daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple act of being a more functioning person helps inspire similar actions among those around me, creating a positive and constructive atmosphere. It&#39;s not selfish, therefore, to help myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this framework, every single action is ultimately for the sake of mutual help. And, since it is the only remotely meaningful thing I could think of, it is the perspective that I much needed to get through the daily grind.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>The Freedom of Unpopularity</title>
          <link>https://jiwonc.net/blog/unpopular/</link>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the best decisions I made in creating this blog was to not chase a readership. Of course, it&#39;d be great if people found my articles interesting, but that&#39;s not the end goal. Even if I was shouting into the void, the mere act of writing articles is meaningful in itself. It gives me the opportunity to parse the messy thoughts in my head. That way, it gives me clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed, there is no email newsletter nor social media promotion for this blog. I have no clue how many people visit this site. It doesn&#39;t even have a niche to exploit, a disaster in search engine optimization (SEO) perspective. Instead, I go about writing about different topics as I please. And honestly, that freedom is more important to me than views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently came across a magnificent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VTsIju1dLI&quot;&gt;TED talk&lt;/a&gt; by Joseph Gordon-Levitt that echoes a similar sentiment. To put into his words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your creativity is driven by a desire to get attention, you are never going to be creatively fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more I go after that powerful feeling of paying attention, the happier I am. But the more I go after the powerful feeling of getting attention, the unhappier I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand because I&#39;ve been there before. I&#39;ve been blogging - albeit in Korean platforms - since 2009. I know my way around how to get exposure. I just know that chasing it ain&#39;t the fulfilling route. It&#39;s difficult and demoralizing. Blogging isn&#39;t the kind of thing you can do consistently if you&#39;re in it for the subscribers. So, the best thing that I can do instead is just surrender. With extreme surrender comes contentment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s such freedom in knowing that I can write what I want for the sake of writing it. It&#39;s doubly nice to know that if one person ever follows this blog, they genuinely enjoy my content. And that would mean more to me than a thousand followers that don&#39;t care.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>A Minimal Online Presence</title>
          <link>https://jiwonc.net/blog/onlinepresence/</link>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I feel like there is an instinctual and incessant urge to publicize everything on the internet ingrained onto us. Personally, simply reading an opinionated post online can trigger a desire to make an account to deliver a clever rebuttal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps as social animals, we are compelled to digest opinions and have our opinions heard. There are more productive methods, however. For instance, I could read well-researched books and articles, and participate in mutually respectful real-world conversations. Waging a poorly organized, scantly fact-checked culture war on the internet is a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not just social media. Why did I find it satisfying to curate my public Goodreads profile? I&#39;m no book reviewer, so I don&#39;t need to publicize it. I don&#39;t need an over-engineered remote database to keep track of books. I can simply create a list myself. (Note from future self: I did create a simple JSON-based list.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve come to question this urge for publicity and to minimize my online presence as much as possible. Currently, only this blog remains. It&#39;s minimal - no ads, no follow buttons, no comment boxes. It&#39;s also rarely visited, partly as a direct consequence of my non-existent social media promotion. I&#39;m okay with that. I love this kind of a quiet internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I am not opposed to all online forums and profile curation services. Some can be useful for specific purposes. For instance, an amateur birdwatcher may make great use out of eBird, an artist may want to have an ArtStation profile, or a developer may use GitHub for collaborative projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My question is, why do we default to these online services that are often over-engineered for most use cases? Do we ever sit down to question whether these tools are the best way to support our crafts and hobbies? Or simply the convenient default? I suspect that often it is the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>The Beauty in Mediocrity</title>
          <link>https://jiwonc.net/blog/mediocrity/</link>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;As someone who has academically excelled since a young age, the most difficult transition in college has been an acceptance in my mediocrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Korea&#39;s Obsession With Success.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am the poster child of a success-driven society. I was raised in South Korea, a country with incomparable academic pressure. In primary school, I received special education for high-performing STEM students. Later in high school, I was my grade&#39;s top-performing competitive mathematician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this academic success came at a cost. I had previously &lt;a href=&quot;https://jiwonc.net/blog/mediocrity/naturewatching&quot;&gt;discussed&lt;/a&gt; my mental and physical health before. Only recently was I formally diagnosed with depression. I am fortunate that I am studying in a US college, where mental health services are readily available. In Korea, the situations are grim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Korea has been the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/03/opinion/south-koreas-struggle-with-suicide.html&quot;&gt;leading country&lt;/a&gt; in suicide rate in the developed world for a decade. For teens, suicide is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20180426000581&quot;&gt;leading cause of death.&lt;/a&gt; For brevity, I will disregard issues such as poor mental health awareness. Instead, I will focus squarely on the success-driven culture which I believe is to be blamed for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An excellent example that illustrates the seriousness of the issue is an indie film, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5633396/&quot;&gt;Fourth Place&lt;/a&gt;, which was nominated for multiple awards for its sharp critique of Korean culture. In it, blatant physical child abuse is tolerated so as long as the child can win a medal in swimming competition to go to college. This critical sentiment is echoed by rapper Huckleberry P in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myHhpAKor70&quot;&gt;Cooler than the Cool.&lt;/a&gt; The lyrics translate to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our country calls bronze medal unsatisfactory,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Without gold on our necks, there is no meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having grown up in this environment, I feel a deep, instinctual sense of guilt if I even dare to approach mediocrity. It is baked into our education to fear failures, to fear slipping grades, and to fear not having enough awards for our college admissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, it is not surprising that depression is omnipresent. Guilt, self-doubt, and demotivation are all textbook symptoms of depression. Take into consideration that these constant stressors exist from childhood, where kids are expected to learn foreign languages in kindergarten, to adulthood, where overworking is commonplace. Such high suicide rates seem plausible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Worldwide Pathological Misconception&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I speak as though Korea is the worse offender of a success-driven culture. It probably is. However, I believe this poison of success is widespread throughout most of the developed world. I observed this notion that everyone should strive to succeed in my time in China and the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that it is an inherent feature of any heavily capitalistic society, which rewards successful people disproportionately more at the expense of those who are less successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the thing: you will most likely be mediocre at most everything you do. This conclusion directly follows from drawing a bell curve and an exponentially decaying distribution, two most likely skill distribution in any given task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, even if you devote your life to be good at something, there are zero guarantees that you will be a star performer. By definition, most professionals are mediocre at their craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, then, do we expect everyone to be successful, to the point of systematically ailing our mental health?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An Alternate Path&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we should choose to appreciate a more abundant fact of live - mediocrity. Our parents are, most likely, mediocre parents. Yet we love our parents. (If you don&#39;t, my condolences for your bad luck.) Our beloved ones, our friends, our best and worst experiences, our talents and flaws, our exceptional ideas and our mundane discoveries, and everything, most likely, is mediocre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this perspective, the very premise of a success-driven culture is flawed. Instead, this realization opens us to a new possibility: excellence in mediocrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new guiding philosophy in life is two-fold. First, we accept that we can be&lt;br /&gt;
mediocre, heck, below-average in many things we strive to be good at, likely forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we also accept that a mediocre life can still be a heck of a good time. So as long as we strive to be marginally better than our past selves, we can find joy, beauty, and fulfillment from a mediocre existence.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Accidental Environmentalism in Minimalism</title>
          <link>https://jiwonc.net/blog/accidental/</link>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;The Green New Deal is still a hot topic in politics, which is remarkable considering that conservation biologists, climatologists, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/JDcro7dPqpA?t=1108&quot;&gt;Bill Nye&lt;/a&gt;  have been shouting into the void for what seems like an eternity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is great that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) and others demand immediate and drastic action, for moderate market-based policies have failed. It is the cold, hard truth that without drastic action, the biosphere will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ipcc.ch/2018/10/08/summary-for-policymakers-of-ipcc-special-report-on-global-warming-of-1-5c-approved-by-governments/&quot;&gt;irreversibly damaged&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;environmental-elitism&quot;&gt;Environmental Elitism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My major concern is how rampant elitism is among environmentalist activists. If you&amp;#39;re an omnivore, you&amp;#39;re a heinous criminal; if you fly, you&amp;#39;re irredeemable; if you use any single-use or plastic product, you&amp;#39;re morally deficient, or the narrative often goes.  &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is completely understandable that &amp;quot;climate extremists&amp;quot;, whom I would more aptly describe &amp;quot;climate-conscious-people-with-common-sense&amp;quot;, are harshly critical of environmentally damaging practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to policies directly related to climate change, keep on pushing, and don&amp;#39;t give ground; we&amp;#39;re fighting the good fight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being consistently adamant about environmentalism, however, can easily turn off the majority of people that simply do not care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unfortunate reality is that we do not need several hundred thousand perfect environmentalists, we need seven billion imperfect environmentalists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;minimalism-is-marketable&quot;&gt;Minimalism is Marketable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Green New Deal isn&amp;#39;t marketable to those that don&amp;#39;t care, and no environmentalist gloom-and-doom will persuade the public unless they figure out how to make people&amp;#39;s lives better right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why minimalism should be the environmentalist&amp;#39;s stealthy mask when talking to those that are so far removed that a straightforward approach will never work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minimalism addresses ubiquitous problems of average persons in a developed nation - mental stress, personal finances, and productivity - which makes it infinitely more marketable than any environmentalist movement can ever be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, minimalism does not go directly with environmentalism. Still, the average self-proclaimed minimalist probably has a lower impact on the environment than the average maximalist simply due to the virtue of owning less material possessions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my suggestion: If someone is critical of the Green New Deal, don&amp;#39;t condemn them, and don&amp;#39;t talk about climate change in front of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, stealthily propose minimalism as a solution to their other practical everyday problems that happen to help the environment along the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;will-minimalism-save-the-world-&quot;&gt;Will minimalism save the world?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d wager that minimalism in itself falls short of that, though it could definitely help. At the very least, it is clear that the developed world needs to drastically change its consumption habits, one Konmari fan at a time. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>The Joy of Nature-Watching in our Technocentric Lives</title>
          <link>https://jiwonc.net/blog/naturewatching/</link>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A necessary counterpart to our modern lives is the reintroduction of the natural world. Few activities brought me more joy than the simple act of observing and photographing wildlife in their natural habitat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Personal Fallout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it is far too easy to completely neglect the natural realm of our existence. Although I used to go out to the woods almost every week, these hobbies were gradually taken over by more sedentary pastimes: browsing the internet, video gaming, and not getting enough outside air in general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I accumulated unhealthy habits to the point where both my physical and mental health was severely crippled. Without being in tune with natural daily rhythm, my routines became erratic. I was eating, sleeping, and working in unsustainable chaos. I was stressed, burnt out, and languished. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only recently did I face this problem directly. It is a lifestyle that I have barely begun recovering from. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nature as Mental Health Sanctuary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nature might be an antidote. It operates in its own clock, largely unperturbed by the hectic cycles of our urban lives. It promotes a sense of existence in the present moment that our technologies do not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be separate from the silent noise of social media and to observe, without trying to manipulate, nature has an almost meditative effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science tends to agree. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/116/11/5188&quot;&gt;Recent research&lt;/a&gt; studied the correlation between exposure to green areas in childhood residency and mental health issues later in life in over 90,000 Americans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were staggering: those who lived in the most urban areas were over 55% more likely to be mentally ill than those who lived in the most rural areas, even after normalizing for other risk factors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s no surprise that urban areas are damaging to our psyche. Our minds were not adapted to handle such a degree of mental overload. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech-junkies like me or the computer scientist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.calnewport.com/blog/2015/10/21/the-power-of-the-outdoor-office/&quot;&gt;Cal Newport&lt;/a&gt; are starting to notice this compulsive need for retreating into nature. We&amp;#39;re the ones most doped into technocentrism, and the ones most heavily affected by it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nature-Watching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I have my old hobby of wildlife photography to fall back to. My observations are posted at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/jeewoongc&quot;&gt;iNaturalist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/skaliq_studios/&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite common perceptions, nature photography is not a hobby that absolutely requires equipment. These days, I only carry an iPhone 8 and a $50 Olloclip macro lens attachment. The photo above is an example of what iPhoneography can achieve. While it is nowhere near professional quality, it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The method of our forays into nature might matter less than that we do. Whether it is birdwatching, wildlife photography, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discoverwildlife.com/how-to/wildlife-gardening/how-to-start-a-wildlife-garden/&quot;&gt;wildlife gardening&lt;/a&gt;, trekking, or eco-tourism, it seems to greatly help our mental health. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>6 Minimalist Gaming Setup Ideas</title>
          <link>https://jiwonc.net/blog/minimalgaming/</link>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Can a gamer also be a minimalist? Of course. Gaming provides value in many of our lives, so many minimalists choose to keep it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, maximalism is all-so pervasive in the gaming industry. It is far too easy to fall into the master race to own the latest rig with the &lt;em&gt;rAy-TrAcEd GaMiNg GpU&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;RGP-POWERED GAMING HARD DRIVE.&lt;/em&gt; (Seriously, what does the word “gaming” on a product label mean anymore?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to own a fully-fledged gaming setup. The physical clutter created by the tower, the peripherals, and the yarn-ball of cables&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; not only disarrayed my room but also my mind. My attention was always fragmented, as my gaming rig covered much of my vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I had to move to another continent to study, I finally decided to go for a more minimal gaming setup. One that is small and portable enough that I can pack it into my luggage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New and exciting emerging technologies allow us to pack performance into an increasingly small footprint. There are many options available, from a standard living room console to eGPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A note of warning!&lt;/strong&gt; Buying new things in order to become more minimalist is antithetical to the spirits of minimalism. Consider switching to the following setups only if you need to get rid of your existing setup anyway. If you are not a gamer, acquiring a minimal gaming setup is not really minimal, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Consoles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While us PC gamers often scoff at the lowly console gamers, consoles are a great option for those that want to couch-game with friends. Consoles also feature exclusive titles that PC gamers can only play through workarounds like emulators or the PlayStation Now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my personal preference, however, needing to pay a monthly subscription to play online games were deal-breakers and not having access to a keyboard and mouse setup were deal breakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cheaper up-front cost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Games are optimized for the platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great for couch gaming with friends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exclusive titles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practically nonexistent keyboard and mouse support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monthly subscription required to play online games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Games are pricier, at usually $60 per title&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Narrower selection of games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gaming Laptops&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most, a gaming laptop is the perfect solution. From budget options to state-of-the-art low-profile gaming behemoths, there&#39;s something for everyone. I love that manufacturers are moving away from flashy gamer-y look and adopting a more office-suitable design. Newer devices have become remarkably good at packing performance and thermals as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re a Windows user, a gaming laptop is a no-brainer. That being said, as a diehard macOS power user, the difficulty of hackintoshing a laptop made this option not viable for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly portable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increasingly powerful and thermally efficient&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Useful for productivity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can&#39;t run macOS (not an issue for some, deal-breaking for me)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can get two out of the trifecta of price, performance, and portability, but not three at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Small Form-Factor PCs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performance that can be put into a small form-factor these days is truly breathtaking. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Systems/c/Cor_Systems&quot;&gt;commercial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.originpc.com/gaming/desktops/chronos/&quot;&gt;products&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pcpartpicker.com/builds/by_part/qtX2FT&quot;&gt;DIY builds&lt;/a&gt; that are a marvel to witness, and a burden to the wallet at the same time. If you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need a desktop gaming PC the size of a console that can run the latest AAA titles at Ultra, go for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very powerful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very small&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good for those that prefer a desktop over a laptop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exorbitantly expensive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For those that need a laptop or a tablet, it means having two devices to manage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More challenging to build than a standard desktop PC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Video Game Streaming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s &amp;quot;The Netflix of Gaming,&amp;quot; they say. You pay a monthly or an hourly fee for the ability to run games on a remote server with the latest hardware. You stream those games through the internet, much like how you would stream videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only do you need a fast and reliable internet connection, but you also need to live in an area close to a data center. That probably means the proximity of a large American city. Another challenge is the same one that Netflix is facing: platform-exclusive titles. You may need to subscribe to multiple streaming services and still be unable to play some indie titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A potential alternative is to &amp;quot;rent&amp;quot; an entire PC through a service like &lt;a href=&quot;https://shadow.tech/&quot;&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt;. You get to use it as your own Windows PC, only through a browser. That means you can play &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; game you own on the Windows platform. And perhaps, this really is the future. My experience with the PlayStation Now can be succinctly summarized as &amp;quot;alright for the price.&amp;quot; As someone that lives outside of the service region for a third of my year, however, it just quite isn&#39;t there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low-ish monthly price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play on any device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No up-front hardware cost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cancel anytime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limited game library (except Shadow)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Needs fast and reliable internet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even with good internet, there is some latency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typically only serviced in parts of the United States and a few other countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Internet Cafés&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s great fun to go to an internet café with some old friends whenever I go back to Korea, or a &amp;quot;PC Bang&amp;quot; as is called there, and jam some esports titles together. You would pay around a dollar per hour to play any popular esports title on the most powerful rig you can dream of. It&#39;s a shame that they&#39;re not a thing outside of Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low hourly price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very powerful setup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good for socializing with gaming buddies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can order food without leaving your computer these days!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doesn&#39;t exist outside of some Asian countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only has the popular eSports titles pre-installed; no Steam games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;External Graphics Cards (eGPUs)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, this is my setup! I use an ultrabook with an external graphics card, which means that the laptop outsources the graphical load to the eGPU. The laptop and the eGPU can communicate fast enough to run video games through the new Thunderbolt 3 technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ultrabook + eGPU setup gives me the power of a desktop PC when I&#39;m at home, while also providing me the portability and productivity of a laptop outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setup also has minimal clutter. When I am gaming, I only need to plug in two USB-C cables: one from the eGPU, and another from a USB-C docking station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the nerdy specifics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use 2017 13&#39;&#39; MacBook Pro with an Aorus RX580 Gaming Box. My USB-C hub of choice is the Plugable USB-C Docking Station. It has power delivery, an HDMI port, a LAN port, 3.5mm audio in/out ports, two USB 2.0 ports, and three USB 3.0 ports. That&#39;s plenty! The only glaring omission is an SD card slot for the creatives out there. My current usages for the USB-C dock are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charging my Macbook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charging my wireless earbuds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charging my graphics calculator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connecting to my Time Machine-formatted Hard Drive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connecting to my (wired USB type-A) mouse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connecting to my Xbox controller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connecting to my headset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(I am currently experimenting with not using an external monitor in an effort to find out which of my possessions are truly essential.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setup was not quite plug-and-play. eGPU is an emerging technology, so making a setup work often requires scouring through &lt;a href=&quot;https://egpu.io/&quot;&gt;egpu.io&lt;/a&gt; to find user guides by early adopters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the AMD graphics cards are officially supported by Apple on the macOS side, it&#39;s up to the user to make it work on Windows via Boot Camp. I experienced the dreaded &amp;quot;error 12,&amp;quot; which means that Windows can&#39;t allocate enough power to the eGPU. Thankfully, an &lt;a href=&quot;http://egpu.io/&quot;&gt;egpu.io&lt;/a&gt; guide provided a fix. If you want an out-of-the-box experience on Boot Camp, I recommend buying an Nvidia graphics card instead. The tradeoff is that it won&#39;t work as smoothly on macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a performance loss of around 10~15% even if you connect the eGPU directly to a monitor. Using internal acceleration on the laptop instead of an external monitor results in another 10% loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, this eGPU setup outputs over 60fps on titles like Overwatch and NieR: Automata. Those that want to run more graphically demanding at higher settings should consider using a graphics card that&#39;s more powerful than an RX580.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good performance in a small form factor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No need to manage multiple devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you already have a graphics card, you only need to buy a chassis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need a laptop with a Thunderbolt 3 port&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not plug-and-play (yet) for certain setups; you may need to browse &lt;a href=&quot;https://egpu.io/&quot;&gt;egpu.io&lt;/a&gt; for user guides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10~15% performance loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

          <title>How I Finally Made Reading Into a Habit</title>
          <link>https://jiwonc.net/blog/readinghabit/</link>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Most people recognize the value of reading books; many of us set a new year&#39;s resolution to read more. We&#39;re pumped up with energy. Yet, it rarely lasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it so hard to make a reading habit stick? Surely, we all know the benefits of reading. Reading books is a great way to self-educate. Reading books improve our writing. Books broaden our perspectives with new ideas. Books provide us entertainment. Books allow us to travel to the greatest minds of our time, or to the most engrossing worlds ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my simple solution: hack your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hacks, Hacks, Hacks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I may have used the word &quot;hack&quot; to grab your attention, I do not plan to provide just another &quot;hack&quot; in the barrage of lifehacks that is the internet. There is this notion that incrementally optimizing our daily functions will inevitably lead to a great life. As a result, we often fail to see the wood as a whole. We fail to make the big, important changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I may have used the word &quot;hack&quot; to grab your attention, I do not plan to provide just another &quot;hack&quot; in the barrage of lifehacks that is the internet. There is this notion that incrementally optimizing our daily functions will inevitably lead to a great life. As a result, we often fail to see the wood as a whole. We fail to make the big, important changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&quot;Let me Check My Book Real Quick&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first tried to read more, I took the advice to bring a book around everywhere. I had Daniel C. Dennett&#39;s - I&#39;m sure is brilliantly written - &quot;From Bacteria to Bach and Back&quot; in my backpack. Guess how much I have read so far, nearly a year after buying it? I finished the introduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with the advice to &quot;bring a book wherever you go&quot; is that we never end up taking the book out of our bag. Why would we, when the phone in our pocket is more easily accessible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we really want to read more books, we should incorporate it into a reading medium that we already use - our smartphones. We &quot;read&quot; on our phones every day. Whether that be social media, forums, online news, or emails, it is probably a part of your habit already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to leverage our existing habit of checking our phones when we feel the trigger of boredom. We only need to change the reward of social media dopamine rush&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; with the joy of reading books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first had this insight, I download some ebooks and resolved to read them instead of my Reddit feed. In reality, whenever I checked my phone, I was welcomed with a barrage of notifications. I forget about the existence of the ebooks that I should be reading and fell back to my old habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried various solutions. I removed social media apps from the notification center. I removed their badge icons. I hid social media apps inside folders. None worked. I&#39;d instinctively check Reddit and Instagram anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Radical(?) Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple &quot;hack&quot; to replace social media with ebooks do not work on its own. We must fundamentally shift the way we view our phones.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; We must delete all source of entertainment from our phones except ebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my iPhone&#39;s home screen, Social media apps, Games, Discord, Shopping apps, Task manager, Email, and News are all gone. The only third-party apps that still remain are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Security apps like 1Password and Authy.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Functions that can&#39;t be replicated on a computer.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Apps that help me focus, such as Calm for meditation and Freedom for blocking distractions.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Messaging apps to communicate with people that are important to me.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Evernote, my digital brain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned my iPhone from a distraction into a carefully curated toolkit. Now, it only performs a few specific tasks that I deem more effectively done on a phone than a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I want to relieve some boredom by checking my phone, there is nothing to do except reading something on iBooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my personal observation, I have the strongest urges to check my phone in these situations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Waiting on a line&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Eating a meal by myself&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Sitting in the bathroom&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When I come back to my dorm and feel tired&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I instinctively pick up my phone to waste some time, and having nothing else to do, resort to reading a book. Once I start reading, I soon get engrossed in it and will be able to read for longer. Despite reading a grand total of zero books last year voluntarily, I finished seven books this year and counting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s even better? Completely minimizing my phone had benefits far beyond reading more books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I am able to devote more attention to the people in front of me.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I am able to sleep better.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I feel less low-key anxiety in daily life.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I have so much more time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I truly believe that this method can work for anyone that uses their smartphones often. We&#39;re not inventing an entirely new habit. We&#39;re merely taking an existing trigger (boredom) and altering its reward (social media notifications) to a better alternative (entertainment value from reading). So as long as you choose books on subjects that you&#39;re enthusiastic about, I think it will work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, you may know that changing the environment is one of the best ways to build a new habit.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; This method is an extreme version of that. We are designing our digital environment like an architect with the clear intention of reading more books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you live in a developed country, chances are, you spend way too much time on your phone anyway.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Why not use that time to enrich our minds?&lt;/p&gt;
